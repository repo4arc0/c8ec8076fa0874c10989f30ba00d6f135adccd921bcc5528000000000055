但好吧  我们现在都用枪了
But I guess we're both doing guns now.

308
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
我之前不知道而已
I just didn't know that.

309
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:32,230
德拉克斯  你为什么没穿火箭的飞行装置
Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs?

310
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,470
穿上疼
It hurts.

311
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,690
穿上疼
It hurts?

312
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,860
我乳头很敏感
I have sensitive nipples.

313
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,680
"我乳头疼  我的天啊"
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"

314
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,520
那他呢  他在干什么
What about him? What's he doing?

315
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,230
我在组装这个  这样就能边干活边听歌了
I'm finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.

316
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,260
这怎么重要了
How is that a priority?

317
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,790
怪奎尔啊  是他那么爱听歌
Blame Quill. He's the one who loves music so much.

318
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,770
不  其实我同意德拉克斯
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.

319
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,760
现在那个可不重要
That's hardly important right now.

320
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,820
好吧  好啊  奎尔
Okay. Sure, Quill.

321
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,930
不  认真的  我同意德拉克斯
No, seriously, I side with Drax.

322
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:02,470
我懂  你现在非常认真
No, I understand that. You're being very serious right now.

323
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,830
我能清楚看见你在眨眼
I can clearly see you winking.

324
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,270
该死  我眨的是左眼吗
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?

325
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,620
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

326
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,960
他们没斜眼看你
They were not looking at you funny.

327
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,060
要动真格的了
Well, that's intense.

328
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,180
格鲁特
Groot!

329
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,890
格鲁特  快闪开  你会受伤的
Groot, get out of the way! You're gonna get hurt!

330
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,210
不不  快吐出来
No! No! Spit it out!

331
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:30,960
快点
Come on!

332
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,530
真恶心
Disgusting!

333
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,430
这怪物的皮太厚了  从外面刺不穿
The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.

334
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,940
必须从里面切穿它
I must cut through it from the inside.

335
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,200
不不  德拉克斯  等等
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!

336
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,340
德拉克斯
Drax!

337
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,360
他干什么
What is he doing?

338
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,150
他说皮太厚了
He said the skin is too thick

339
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,490
从外面刺不穿  所以他
to be pierced from the outside, so he...

340
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,210
-这根本没道理  -我想告诉他来着
- That doesn't make any sense! - I tried telling him that!

341
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,400
它的皮不管内外
Skin is the same level of thickness

342
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,990
都一样厚
from the inside as from the outside!

343
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,600
我意识到了
I realize that.

344
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,140
它脖子上有个切口
There is a cut on its neck.

345
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,140
火箭  让它抬头
Rocket, get it to look up.

346
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,090
你个大海猴子  看上面
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!

347
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,290
小心  奎尔
Watch it, Quill!

348
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,210
太棒了  我一个人打败了这头怪物
Yes! I have single-handedly vanquished the beast!

349
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,380
怎么了
What?

350
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,940
它们叫什么来着
What are they called again?

351
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,030
能量电池
Anulax batteries.

352
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,290
棱酿电池
Harbulary batteries.

353
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,650
跟我说的完全不搭边
That's nothing like what I just said.

354
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,390
但它们每个都值几万块
But they're worth thousands of units apiece

355
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,840
所以索维林族雇我们保护它们
which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.

356
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,070
跟这些人打交道小心措辞  他们很容易生气
Careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended.

357
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,020
冒犯了他们会被处死
The cost of transgression is death.

358
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,940
我们感谢你们拿生命冒险  银河护卫队
We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.

359
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,280
我们不能让索维林子民去冒生命危险
We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.

360
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,490
每个人都完全是按照族群的设计诞生的
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.

361
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,030
身体和头脑都完美无缺
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.

362
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,280
我们控制后代的DNA
We control the DNA of our progeny...

363
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,680
让他们在生育荚里发育
germinating them in birthing pods.

364
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,620
我更喜欢用传统办法造人
I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.

365
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,560
也许哪天你可以给我讲讲历史
Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...

366
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,370
讲讲我们祖先古老的方法
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.

367
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,190
为了学术研究
For academic purposes.

368
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,110
我很荣幸  好的
I would be honored, yes.

369
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,680
以学术研究的名义
In the name of research...

370
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,490
我觉得那会非常
I think that could be pretty...

371
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,880
非常令人反感
pretty repulsive.

372
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,620
我不喜欢随便...
I'm not into that kind of casual...

373
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,800
行了
Oh, please.

374
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,330
你们答应我们出力会有报酬的
Your people promised something in exchange for our services.

375
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,900
拿出来  我们马上就走
Bring it and we shall gladly be on our way.

376
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,900
家人团聚
Family reunion.

377
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,400
我知道她是你妹妹
I understand she is your sister.

378
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,580
她对我来说  只值山达尔的悬赏而已
She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.

379
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,310
她想盗窃电池  被我们的士兵抓了个正着
Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.

380
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,890
请随意处置她吧
Do with her as you please.

381
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,280
我们非常感谢您  阿耶莎大祭司
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

382
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,460
你是什么出身  奎尔先生
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

383
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,360
我母亲来自地球
My mother is from Earth.

384
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,050
你父亲呢
And your father?

385
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,750
他不是密苏里人  我只知道这些
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.

386
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,840
我在你身上看到了
I see it within you.

387
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,980
一种不同寻常的血统
An unorthodox genealogy.

388
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,470
这种混血看起来特别...
A hybrid that seems particularly...

389
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,830
鲁莽
reckless.

390
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,840
你知道吗  我听说你们都是自以为是的混蛋
You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags...

391
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,780
但那完全不是事实
but that isn't true at all.

392
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,390
糟糕
Oh, shit.

393
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,880
我又用错眼睛了  是吗
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?

394
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,270
我很抱歉  我没想被你发现的
I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.

395
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,470
他们没杀你算你走运
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.

396
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,820
还用你说
You're telling me.

397
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,950
你想买点电池吗
You wanna buy some batteries?

398
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,450
好吧  我们把小秃子送去山达尔领赏吧
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar and collect that bounty.

399
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,580
她说我父亲的那些话
That stuff about my father...

400
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:28,670
她以为她是谁啊
Who does she think she is?

401
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,190
我知道你对那件事有点敏感
I know you're sensitive about that.

402
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,000
我才没有敏感  我只是不知道他是什么人
I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.

403
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,420
如果我看起来像是在跟大祭司调情那很抱歉
Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.

404
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,900
我没那个意思
I wasn't.

405
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,340
即使你有我也不在意
I don't care if you were.

406
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,760
我觉得你在意
Well, I feel like you do care.

407
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,900
所以我在道歉  对不起
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!

408
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,420
卡魔拉不适合你  奎尔
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.

409
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,000
鬼鬼祟祟的
Damn shadow.

410
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,320
宇宙中有两种人
There are two types of beings in the universe...

411
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:56,300
一种是跳舞的人  另一种是不跳舞的人
those who dance, and those who do not.

412
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,740
我第一次见到我的爱人是在一场战争集会上
I first met my beloved at a war rally.

413
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,650
天哪
Oh, God.

414
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,020
村子里每个人都在跳舞
Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.

415
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:05,400
除了一个女人
Except one woman.

416
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,170
我的奥薇特
My Ovette.

417
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:10,340
我立刻就知道她是我的真命天女
I knew immediately she was the one for me.

418
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,190
即使听着最有旋律的音乐
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.

419
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,720
她连脚都不会点一下
She wouldn't even tap her foot.

420
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,030
动都不会动一下
Wouldn't move a muscle.

421
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:21,340
看上去就像是死了
One might assume she was dead.

422
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,530
听起来很性感
That does sound pretty hot.

423
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,090
我下面都要充血了
It would make my nether regions engorge.

424
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:28,120
好吧  我懂了  没错
Okay. I get it, yes.

425
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,710
我是个舞者  而卡魔拉不是
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.

426
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,660
你只需要找到一个跟你一样不着调的女人
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.

427
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,570
我饿了  那些亚罗根给我来点
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.

428
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,430
不行  还没熟
No. It's not ripe yet...

429
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,310
而且我恨你
and I hate you.

430
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,420
你恨我
You hate me?

431
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:49,460
你丢下了我  自己去偷那块石头了
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.

432
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:52,050
而现在你却像个英雄一样
And yet here you stand, a hero.

433
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,930
很快我就能摆脱这枷锁
I will be free of these shackles soon enough,

434
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:55,290
然后我会杀了你
and I will kill you.

435
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,530
我发誓
I swear.

436
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:57,480
不
No.

437
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,640
你会在山达尔的监狱里
You're gonna live out the rest of your days

438
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,980
度过余生
in a prison on Xandar...

439
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,490
做那个白日梦
wishing you could.

440
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,640
奇怪
This is weird.

441
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,750
有一队索维林飞船从后面追上来了
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.

442
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,850
他们为什么要这样
Why would they do that?

443
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,760
可能是因为火箭偷了他们几个电池
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.

444
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,770
老兄
Dude!

445
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,070
哦
Right.

446
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,680
他没偷电池
He didn't steal some of those.

447
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,870
我不知道他们为什么追我们  真奇怪啊
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.

448
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,050
你怎么想的
What were you thinking?

449
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,990
哥们  那些电池真的很容易偷
Dude, they were really easy to steal!

450
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,470
-这就是你的辩解  -拜托
- That's your defense? - Come on!

451
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,020
你看到那个大祭司高高在上的样子了
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.

452
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,690
我这是在教训她
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!

453
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,220
我没想到你的动机这么无私
I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.

454
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,290
真是遗憾啊
It's really a shame

455
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,700
那些索维林人没领会到你的好意
the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...

456
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,610
-还想杀掉我们  -说的太对了
- and they're trying to kill us. - Exactly!

457
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,460
我是在讽刺你
I was being sarcastic!

458
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,110
不
Oh, no!

459
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,450
你应该用讽刺的语气  这下我出丑了
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice! Now I look foolish!

460
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,560
斗嘴先省省好不好
Can we put the bickering on hold

461
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,140
活过这场太空大战再说
until after we survive this massive space battle?

462
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,670
-更多敌人朝我们来了  -很好
- More incoming! - Good!

463
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,450
我想杀杀人
I wanna kill some guys!

464
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,630
你谁也没杀掉
You're not killing anyone.

465
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,600
这些飞船都是遥控驾驶的
All those ships are remotely piloted.

466
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,820
该死
Damn it!

467
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,380
在磨蹭什么  舰队司令
What is the delay, Admiral?

468
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,320
大祭司  那些电池
High Priestess, the batteries,

469
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,320
它们极其易燃
they are exceptionally combustible...

470
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,780
可能会摧毁整个舰队
and could destroy the entire fleet.

471
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,780
我们在意的是他们对我们的不敬
Our concern is their slight against our people.

472
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,570
我们雇佣了他们  他们却偷我们的
We hired them and they steal from us.

473
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,880
这是最大的亵渎
It is heresy of the highest order.

474
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,870
所有操作单位
All command modules...

475
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:52,020
对目标格杀勿论
fire with the intent to kill.

476
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,350
最近的宜居星球是哪里
What's the nearest habitable planet?

477
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,530
是一个叫博赫特的星球
It's called Berhert.

478
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,540
-需要几次星际跳跃  -只要一次
- How many jumps? - Only one.

479
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,040
但进入点在47公里外
But the access point is 47 clicks away.

480
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,390
而且你得穿过那片量子小行星群
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.

481
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,910
奎尔  要想穿过那里
Quill, to make it through that

482
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,070
你得是全宇宙最棒的飞行员
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.

483
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,430
那我们走运了
Lucky for us,

484
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,050
-我就...  -我就是
- I... - I am.

485
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,570
你在干什么
What are you doing?

486
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,770
我从十岁就开始开这玩意了
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.

487
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,720
我就是为开宇宙飞船而设计制造的
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.

488
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,460
你就是设计制造成了个混蛋
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!

489
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,880
-别闹了  -奎尔
- Stop it. - Quill.

490
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:54,000
今天晚上  你躺在床上的时候
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed

491
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,060
你的枕套里会有黏糊糊的一坨
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.

492
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,490
你会想"这是什么"
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"

493
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,290
那会是我放的一坨屎
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!

494
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,570
你敢把你的屎放我床上  我就剃光你
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.

495
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,310
才不会放我的
It won't be my turd.

496
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,790
我会放德拉克斯的
It will be Drax's.

497
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,340
我的屎蛋出了名的大
I have famously huge turds.

498
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,820
我们都快要死了  现在就讨论这个吗
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?

499
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,320
混蛋
Son of a...

500
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,150
哥们  搞什么
Dude! Seriously!

501
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,560
我来...
Let me...

502
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,490
蠢货
Idiots!

503
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,920
奎尔开飞船就这下场
Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.

504
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,990
还有一架索维林飞船在追我们
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.

505
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:47,220
我们武器坏了
Our weapons are down.

506
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,820
还有20公里跳跃
Twenty clicks to the jump!

507
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,150
坐稳了
Hold on.

508
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,440
还没熟呢
It's not ripe.

509
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,440
加油  扎莱克  你可以的
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.

510
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,030
太棒了
Yes!

511
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,380
还有15公里跳跃
Fifteen clicks to the jump!

512
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,260
加油
Come on!

513
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,190
继续
Keep going!

514
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,320
还有10公里
Ten clicks!

515
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,740
去死吧  破船
Die, spaceship!

516
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,790
你弱爆了  扎莱克
You suck, Zylak.

517
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,820
不出所料
Typical.

518
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,940
还有五公里
Five clicks!

519
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,910
混蛋
Son of a...

520
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,160
他们绕过了星群
They went around the field!

521
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,290
有人摧毁了我们所有的飞船
Someone destroyed all our ships!

522
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,940
什么
What?

523
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,040
是谁
Who?

524
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,300
还有一公里
One click!

525
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,980
-那是什么  -管他呢
- What is that? - Who cares?

526
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,390
跳跃点就在那儿  快  快
That's the jump point! Go! Go!

527
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,400
那是个人
It's a guy.

528
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,540
天啊
Oh, my God.

529
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,870
他还在外面吗
He's still out there?

530
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,670
格鲁特  系好安全带
Groot, put your seatbelt on!

531
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:28,400
准备好要强行降落了
Prepare for a really bad landing!

532
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:09,480
刚才太赞了
That was awesome!

533
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,390
棒
Yes!

534
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,480
你看看
Look at this!

535
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
咱们飞船的另一半呢
Where is the other half of our ship?

536
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,030
是我的船
My ship.

537
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,040
你们任何一个都可以带我们平安穿过星群
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...

538
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,930
如果你们肯用上面这个
had you flown with what's between your ears

539
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,570
而不是下面那个驾驶飞船
instead of what's between your legs!

540
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:29,540
如果我下面那个长了手
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...

541
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,540
那我绝对可以用它来降落飞船
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.

542
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,360
彼得
Peter,

543
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:34,530
我们差点被你的傲慢害死
we almost died because of your arrogance.

544
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:37,930
是因为他偷能量电池还差不多
More like because he stole the Anulax batteries!

545
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,300
那个叫棱酿电池
They're called Harbulary batteries.

546
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,700
不  不叫那个
No, they're not!

547
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,170
你知道我为什么那么做吗  星嚼
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch?

548
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,870
我才不叫星嚼
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."

549
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,950
因为我乐意
I did it because I wanted to!

550
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,550
混蛋
Dick.

551
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,850
我们为什么要讨论这个
What are we even talking about this for?

552
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,850
刚才有个小人炸了五十艘飞船救了我们
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!

553
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:54,860
有多小
How little?

554
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,870
我也不知道  大概这么小
Well, I don't know, like this?

555
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
一个一英寸的小人救了我们吗
A little one-inch man saved us?

556
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
他要是近一点  肯定就会大一点吧
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.

557
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,560
那叫近大远小  你个傻浣熊
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.

558
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,300
别叫我浣熊
Don't call me a raccoon!

559
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,860
抱歉  是我过分了
I'm sorry. I took it too far.

560
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,320
我是想说垃圾熊猫
I meant trash panda.

561
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,510
那样好听点吗
Is that better?

562
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,040
我不知道
I don't know.

563
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,400
这个更损  这个损多了
It's worse. It's so much worse.

564
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,850
你个混蛋
You son of a...

565
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,150
-我受够你了  -别过来
- I've had it with you! - No! Back up!

566
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,180
有人从跳跃点跟着你们来了
Someone followed you through the jump point.

567
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,360
放了我  你们需要我帮忙
Set me free, you'll need my help.

568
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,200
我又不傻  星云
I'm not a fool, Nebula.

569
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,290
如果在战斗中拒绝帮助就是犯傻
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.

570
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,060
我一放了你  你就会攻击我的
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.

571
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,860
我不会的
No, I won't.

572
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,400
你这种超级大坏蛋不是应该很会说谎吗
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.

573
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,410
我赌是那个一英寸的小人
I bet it's the one-inch man.

574
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,870
时隔这么多年  我终于找到你了
After all these years, I've found you.

575
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,480
你到底是谁
And who the hell are you?

576
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,460
我以为我沧桑帅气的外表就足以说明了
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.

577
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,750
我叫伊戈
My name is Ego...

578
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,340
我是你爸爸  彼得
and I'm your dad, Peter.

579
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,800
你知道俗话怎么说的
You know what they say...

580
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,530
"跟过鸭鸭  好运就来"
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."

581
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,520
勇度
Yondu!

582
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,550
快下来
Come on down!

583
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:34,340
兜兜转转这么多年
After going around years in circles...

584
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,880
跟我最终娶的这女人周旋
with this woman I end up marrying.

585
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,640
我说  "艾丽塔  我爱你
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...

586
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,230
但你真是疯了"
"But you're losing your mind!"

587
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,230
话说回来  她一直都那样
Then again, she's always been that way.

588
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,910
我从来都不能相信她
I could never trust her. You know?

589
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,590
斯塔卡
Stakar.

590
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,990
好久不见
It's been some time.

591
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,370
看来这个场子
It seems like this establishment

592
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,720
堕落错了方式
is the wrong kind of disreputable.

593
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,710
-先生  -斯塔卡
- Sir! - Stakar!

594
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:09,060
掠夺者有一百个派系
There's a hundred Ravager factions.

595
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,390
你为了接待其中一个  而失去了剩下99个的
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.

596
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,040
求你了  先生  别走
Please, sir. Please!

597
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,850
-别碰我  -求你
- Get away from me. - Please!

598
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,000
你下地狱吧
You can go to hell then!

599
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:26,140
我不在乎你怎么看我
I don't give a damn what you think of me!

600
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,890
那你跟着我们干什么
So what are you following us for?

601
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,520
因为你必须听我说
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!

602
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,750
我什么都不用听  是你背叛了准则
I don't gotta listen to nothing! You betrayed the code!

603
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,790
掠夺者不买卖孩子
Ravagers don't deal in kids.

604
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,570
我告诉过你  我不知道是怎么回事
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!

605
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,340
你不知道
You didn't know

606
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,320
是因为你不想知道
because you didn't want to know

607
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,400
因为你靠这个发财
because it made you rich.

608
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,100
我要求有一席之地  我跟你们一样佩戴焰标
I demand a seat at the table! I wear these flames, same as you.

609
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,530
你虽然穿得像我们
You may dress like us...

610
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,620
但你死后别想听到自由号角声  勇度
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.

611
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:51,970
奥戈尔的颜色
And the Colors of Ogord...

612
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,940
也绝不会在你的墓上闪耀
will never flash over your grave.

613
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,820
要是你觉得
If you think...

614
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,380
流放你  让我高兴
I take pleasure in exiling you...

615
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,970
那你就错了
you're wrong.

616
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,010
你伤了我们所有人的心
You broke all our hearts.

617
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,350
可悲
Pathetic.

618
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,090
起先  奎尔背叛了我们
First, Quill betrays us...

619
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,330
结果勇度把他毫发无伤地放走了
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.

620
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:36,340
我们跟随他  是因为他
We followed him because he was the one

621
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,090
敢做不得不做的事
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.

622
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:41,530
看来他变软弱了
Seems he's goin' soft.

623
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,190
要是他软弱  你这么小声干吗
If he's so soft, why are you whispering for?

624
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,560
你知道我说得对  克拉林
You know I'm right, Kraglin.

625
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:51,820
小心点  怎么说我们船长呢
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.

626
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,550
这是谁
Who the hell is that?

627
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,560
勇度·尤冬塔
Yondu Udonta...

628
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,070
我有个提议
I have a proposition for you.

629
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:41,130
你母亲去世后
I hired Yondu to pick you up

630
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,980
我雇了勇度去接你
when your mother passed away.

631
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,130
但他没有把你还给我
But instead of returning you...

632
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,620
而是把你留下了
Yondu kept you.

633
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,350
我不知道为什么
I have no clue as to why.

634
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,130
我告诉你为什么
Well, I'll tell you why.

635
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,820
因为我是个瘦得皮包骨的小孩
Because I was a skinny little kid

636
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,520
能溜进成年人进不去的地方
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.

637
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,210
偷东西更容易
It made it easier for thievin'.

638
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,640
从那时起  我就一直在寻找你的下落
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.

639
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:02,570
我还以为勇度是你父亲
I thought Yondu was your father.

640
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,940
什么  我们在一起这么久
What? We've been together this whole time

641
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,570
你以为勇度是我的血亲
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?

642
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,380
你俩长得一模一样
You look exactly alike.

643
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,000
勇度是蓝的
One's blue!

644
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,480
不  他不是我父亲
No, he's not my father!

645
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,570
勇度绑架了我
Yondu was the guy who abducted me

646
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,720
把我打得满地找牙  让我学会怎么打架
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight

647
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,350
威胁要吃了我  让我一直担惊受怕
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.

648
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,920
-吃了你  -是啊
- Eat you? - Yeah.

649
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,780
那个王八蛋
That son of a bitch.

650
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,540
你怎么找到我们的
How'd you locate us now?

651
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:30,160
哪怕像我住得那么偏僻
Even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known

652
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,970
也听说过传说中的星爵
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.

653
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,860
我们现在就出发去那儿怎么样
What say we head out there right now?

654
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:36,400
欢迎你的伙伴一起去
Your associates are welcome.

655
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,420
包括那只三角脸猴子
Even that triangle-faced monkey there.

656
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,980
我保证
I promise you...

657
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,840
那是一个与众不同的地方
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.

658
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,320
在那里
And there...

659
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,240
我能给你解释你特别的身世
I can explain your very special heritage.

660
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,790
终于能做
Finally get to be the...

661
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,780
我一直想做的那个父亲了
father I've always wanted to be.

662
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,220
失陪了
Excuse me.

663
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,570
我去撒泡尿
I've gotta take a whiz.

664
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,080
我不信
I'm not buying it.

665
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,030
我们去散步吧
Let's go take a walk.

666
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:19,710
我叫螳螂
I am Mantis.

667
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,720
你在干什么
What are you doing?

668
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,240
微笑
Smiling.

669
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,330
我听说  这样做能让人们喜欢你
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.

670
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,470
你那么笑可不能
Not if you do it like that.

671
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:37,520
我一个人在伊戈的星球上长大
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.

672
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,500
我不了解人际交流的微妙
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.

673
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:47,140
我能摸摸你的狗狗吗  它好可爱
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.

674
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:51,660
可以
Yes.

675
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,810
这叫恶作剧
That is called a practical joke!

676
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:10,290
我很喜欢
I liked it very much!

677
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,440
是我刚想的
I just made it up!

678
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,660
饶了我吧
Give me a break!

679
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,220
都过了这么久了  突然出现
After all this time, you're gonna show up,

680
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,030
-还突然要当我爸  -是啊
- and just all of a sudden you wanna be my dad? - I hear you.

681
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,390
另外  这可能是个陷阱  好吗
And by the way, this could be a trap. Okay?

682
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,110
克里纯种主义者  掠夺者
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...

683
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,190
-都想杀死我们  -我知道  但是
- they all want us dead. - I know, but...

684
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,110
但是什么
But what?

685
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,910
你给我讲的扎渡·霍索妇的故事呢
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?

686
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,770
谁
Who?

687
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,460
有一艘魔法船的那个
He owned a magic boat?

688
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,510
大卫·霍索夫
David Hasselhoff?

689
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,140
就是他
Right.

690
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,640
不是魔法船  是会说话的车
Not a magic boat. A talking car.

691
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,920
为什么会说话来着
Why did he talk again?

692
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:44,400
为了帮他打击犯罪  并给予精神支持
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.

693
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,140
你小时候会随身带着他的照片
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket

694
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,170
告诉其他小孩
and you would tell all the other children

695
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,610
说他是你父亲  但他出门了
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.

696
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,210
拍摄《霹雳游侠》或者跟乐队在德国巡回演出
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.

697
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:55,580
那是我喝醉时告诉你的
I told you that when I was drunk.

698
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,800
你现在提它干吗
Why are you bringing that up now?

699
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,020
我喜欢那个故事
I love that story.

700
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,840
我讨厌那个故事
I hate that story.

701
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,550
太可悲了
It's so sad!

702
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,640
我小时候总是看着其他孩子
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off

703
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,800
跟他们的爸爸玩投接球
playing catch with their dad. And I

704
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,890
我也想让爸爸陪我玩  那是我最大的心愿
I wanted that, more than anything in the world!

705
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,730
我就想说这个  彼得
That's my point, Peter.

706
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,970
如果这个人就是你的霍索夫呢
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?

707
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,070
听着  如果我们发现他是坏人
Listen, if he ends up being evil...

708
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,330
那就杀了他
we will just kill him.

709
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,440
你要把我丢给那只狐狸
You're leaving me with that fox?

710
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,760
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

711
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,980
要是她行为可疑  就开枪打她
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.

712
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,910
-或者你想打就打  -好
- Or if you feel like it. - Okay.

713
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,320
就几天而已
It'll be just a couple of days.

714
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,940
还没等火箭修好飞船  我们就能回来了
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.

715
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,490
要是索维林人来了怎么办
What if the Sovereign come?

716
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,810
他们不可能知道我们在这儿  走吧
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.

717
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,050
我觉得兵分两路不太好
I'm uncertain about parting ways.

718
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,440
天啊  你就像个老太婆
God, you're like an old woman.

719
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,180
因为我睿智吗
Because I'm wise?

720
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,260
你怎么有这么多行李
Why do you have so much luggage?

721
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,230
我不想让格鲁特乱动我的东西
I don't want Groot playing with my things.

722
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:11,150
希望老爸不像你那么混蛋  小孤儿
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.

723
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,720
你的目的是什么  让所有人都讨厌你吗
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?

724
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,520
你成功了
Because it's working.

725
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,350
我能问你个私人问题吗
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

726
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:13,270
还没人问过我私人问题呢
No one has ever asked me a personal question.

727
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,910
你的触角是干什么的
Your antennae, what are they for?

728
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,660
触角的用途
Their purpose?

729
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,620
对  奎尔和我打了个赌
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.

730
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,510
哥们  你不应该说出来的
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!

731
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,730
我说
I say...

732
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:25,360
当你要穿过一个很低的门框时
that if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...

733
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,930
你的触角能感知高度
your antennae will feel this,

734
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,550
防止你撞掉脑袋
and keep you from being decapitated.

735
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:30,260
对  如果是任何
Right. And if it's anything other than

736
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,290
防止掉脑袋之外的用途  那我赢
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.

737
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,620
它们不是感知门框用的
They are not for feeling doorways.

738
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:39,760
我觉得
I think...

739
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,220
它们跟我的共情能力有关
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.

740
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,390
那是什么
What are those?

741
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,610
我触碰别人时  我能感觉到他们的感受
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.

742
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:50,670
-你会读心术  -不是
- You read minds? - No.

743
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,940
心灵感应是感知想法
Telepaths know thoughts.

744
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,590
共情是感知感情
Empaths feel feelings.

745
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,420
情绪
Emotions.

746
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,410
可以吗
May I?

747
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:03,900
好
All right.

748
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:15,230
你怀着爱
You feel love.

749
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,520
是的  我怀着一种
Yeah. I guess I feel a general,

750
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,930
-对所有人的无私的大爱  -不
- unselfish love for just about everybody. - No!

751
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,400
是浪漫的  肉欲的爱
Romantic, sexual love.

752
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,590
我才没
No, I don't.

753
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,270
-爱的是她  -不
- For her! - No!

754
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,480
不是
That is not...

755
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:30,190
好吧
Okay.

756
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,340
她把你最不可告人的秘密说出来了
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!

757
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,360
哥们  拜托  你有点反应过度了
Dude, come on, I think you're overreacting a little bit!

758
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,740
你肯定尴尬死了
You must be so embarrassed!

759
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,450
来感知一下我  试试我
Do me! Do me! Do me!

760
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,740
我从来没感觉过如此的幽默
I have never felt such humor!

761
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,610
真是讨厌到难以置信
So unbelievably uncool.

762
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,450
奎尔
Quill.

763
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,710
敢摸我  你就只能感觉到下巴骨折
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.

764
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:18,350
我也可以稍微改变人的情绪
I can also alter emotions to some extent.

765
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,540
比如
Yeah, like what?

766
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,030
如果我碰到悲伤的人
If I touch someone who is sad...

767
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,760
我可以安抚他们  让他们获得暂时的满足感
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.

768
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,450
我可以让固执的人变顺从
I can make a stubborn person compliant.

769
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,830
但我主要用我的能力帮助主人入睡
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.

770
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,570
他夜里想着后代  无法入睡
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.

771
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,620
在我身上试试那个
Do one of those on me.

772
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,190
睡吧
Sleep.

773
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,850
我喜欢这首歌
I love this song.

774
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,840
在那儿
There!

775
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,940
没了那些玩具  你就没那么厉害了吧
Ain't so tough now without all your toys...

776
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,840
是不是
are you?

777
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
闪开
Move!

778
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,010
糟了
Crap.

779
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,180
好啊  耗子
Hey there, rat!

780
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,350
你好吗  你个蓝蠢货
How's it going, you blue idiot?

781
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:11,740
还不错
Not so bad.

782
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,020
我们接了一份美差
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.

783
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,650
有个自命不凡的金闪闪的姑娘
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself has

784
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,390
给我们开出很高的价码
offered us a large sum

785
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,070
要我们抓到你和你的同伴交给她
to deliver you and your pals over to her

786
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,890
因为她想杀了你们
because she wants to kill y'all.

787
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,770
你的朋友
Your friend...

788
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,780
敌人太多了
There's too many of them.

789
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:31,530
他需要我帮忙  要是你在乎他
He needs my help. If you care about him...

790
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:34,480
你得帮我解开手铐
you need to get me out of these bonds.

791
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,460
他们会杀了他的
They are going to kill him!

792
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:39,020
告诉你  找到你可容易了
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.

793
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,920
山达尔大战的时候  我在你们飞船上
I put a tracer on your ship back there

794
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,630
放了个追踪器
during the war over Xandar.

795
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:45,030
你保证不伤害格鲁特
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...

796
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:47,510
我就告诉你电池在哪
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.

797
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:50,800
你真走运  我说话不算数
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.

798
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,770
不然我就把你们交出去了
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.

799
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,690
不然你就什么
Otherwise, you'd what?

800
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,830
我们把电池拿走
We'll take them batteries.

801
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,250
它们值多少  在市场上能卖个25万
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?

802
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:03,830
那个祭司答应给我们一百万
That Priestess offered us a million.

803
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:06,830
25万才三分之一
A quarter is only one third of that!

804
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,080
25万不是三分之一
A quarter ain't a third.

805
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,290
25万就是25
A quarter is 25.

806
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:10,940
不是
No.

807
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,660
25连双靴子都卖不来
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.

808
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,630
够了
Enough!

809
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:17,590
重点是  我们没那么蠢
The point is, we ain't stupid enough

810
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,040
会帮忙把银河护卫队杀掉
to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!

811
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,580
整个新星军团都不会放过我们的
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.

812
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:24,190
这样不对
That ain't right!

813
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,840
我就说这一次  船长
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.

814
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:31,190
不管奎尔背叛你几次
No matter how many times Quill betrays you

815
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,030
你都会保护他  就好像我们其他人都不重要
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!

816
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,100
是啊
Yeah!

817
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,050
我才是会支持你的人
I'm the one what sticks up for you!

818
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:37,890
别激动  克拉林
Take it easy, Kraglin.

819
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,800
说对了  伙计  他是心变软了
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.

820
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:44,000
或许改换个领导人了
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.

821
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,060
放下你们的枪
Put your damn guns down!

822
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,110
这事肯定是可以和平解决的  各位
There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas.

823
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:58,920
哪怕是武力解决也好  只要我站那边
Or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.

824
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,980
你们好啊  小伙子们
Well, hello, boys.

825
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,940
没熟
It's not ripe.

826
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,260
各位  欢迎来到我的世界
Welcome, everyone, to my world.

827
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,310
你有自己的星球
You have your own planet?

828
00:43:18,310 --> 00:43:21,580
没什么的  也不比地球的月亮大
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.

829
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,210
谦逊
Humility.

830
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,750
我喜欢
I like it.

831
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:28,050
我也是个非常谦虚的人
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.

832
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:11,530
你有自己的星球
You own a planet

833
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:14,330
还能不穿太空服就干掉几十艘飞船
and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.

834
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,560
你究竟是什么人
What are you exactly?

835
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,290
我是所谓的天神  亲爱的
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.

836
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,340
天神  你是个神吗
A Celestial, like a god?

837
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,700
就是个普通神  儿子
Small "G," Son.

838
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:32,000
至少在我跟德拉克斯一样谦逊的日子里是的
At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.

839
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:49,730
我也不知道我究竟从哪来
I don't know where I came from exactly.

840
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,380
我最初的记忆是闪烁
First thing I remember is flickering

841
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,630
漂浮在宇宙中
adrift in the cosmos utterly

842
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,670
完全孤独地存在着
and entirely alone.

843
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,910
经历了数百万年
Over millions of years

844
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:04,680
我学会了控制我周围的分子
I learned to control the molecules around me.

845
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:08,240
我越来越聪明  越来越强大
I grew smarter and stronger.

846
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,150
我不断地建造着
And I continued building from there...

847
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,030
一层又一层
layer by layer...

848
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,050
最终建成了你们现在脚下的星球
the very planet you walk on now.

849
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:21,570
但我不满足
But I wanted more.

850
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,680
我渴望
I desired...

851
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,520
意义
meaning.

852
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,560
我想着  这宇宙中肯定还有
"There must be some life out there in the universe...

853
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,890
我之外的生命
"Besides just me," I thought.

854
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:37,670
于是  我立志要找到生命
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.

855
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,780
我创造了
I created...

856
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,560
我所想象的生物生命
what I imagined biological life to be like...

857
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,820
包括最细微的细节
down to the most minute detail.

858
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:50,170
你做老二了吗
Did you make a penis?

859
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,040
哥们
Dude!

860
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,500
你什么毛病啊
What is wrong with you?

861
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,190
如果他是个星球  怎么能跟你母亲造人啊
If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?

862
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,750
他会压扁她的
He would smush her!

863
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,680
我不想听我父母是怎么...
I don't need to hear how my parents...

864
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,750
为什么
Why?

865
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,190
我父亲每年冬至
My father would tell the story of

866
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,180
都会讲述他让我母亲怀孕的故事
impregnating my mother every winter solstice.

867
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,330
太恶心了
That's disgusting.

868
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,170
那很美
It was beautiful.

869
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,140
你们地球人真有病
You Earthers have hang-ups.

870
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,130
是啊  德拉克斯  我有老二
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.

871
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,700
谢谢
Thank you!

872
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,160
而且不赖
It's not half bad.

873
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:25,280
我还有痛觉  消化系统
I've also got pain receptors, and a digestive system and

874
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,770
和所有附带的一切
all the accompanying junk.

875
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:32,340
我想真正地体验为人
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human

876
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,140
于是我探索群星
as I set out amongst the stars...

877
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,030
直到我找到了
until I found...

878
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,660
我所寻找的
what I sought.

879
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,590
生命
Life.

880
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,780
我在这宇宙中终究不是孤独的
I was not alone in the universe after all.

881
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:55,330
你什么时候认识我母亲的
When did you meet my mother?

882
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,130
不久之后
Not long after.

883
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:12,080
是梅瑞狄斯让我第一次体验了爱
It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.

884
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,440
我
I

885
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,020
喊她我的水百合
called her my river lily.

886
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,530
那份爱  彼得
And from that love, Peter...

887
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:30,340
创造了你
you.

888
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:40,780
我找了你好久
I have searched for you for so long.

889
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,800
当我听说一个地球人
And when I heard of a man from Earth

890
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,050
手握无限宝石还能不死
who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...

891
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,340
我就知道你一定是我所爱的女人的儿子
I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.

892
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:56,920
如果你爱她  为什么要离开她
If you loved her, why did you leave her?

893
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,710
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

894
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,390
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

895
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,420
这是哗变
This is mutiny!

896
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:39,310
你们这些渣滓
You're scum!

897
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:16,050
船长
Captain!

898
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,810
救我啊
Help me! Please!

899
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:19,870
船长
Captain!

900
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,690
是你害死了那些人
You're the one what killed those men

901
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,030
你领他们走错了路
by leading them down the wrong path.

902
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:30,070
因为你软弱
Because you're weak.

903
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,120
还愚蠢
And stupid!

904
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,690
现在  掠夺者
It's time for the Ravagers

905
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,720
要再次恢复荣誉  追随新船长
to rise once again to glory with a new captain...

906
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:46,100
电击脸
Taserface!

907
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:56,090
抱歉  抱歉  你名叫
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Your name is...

908
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,970
电击脸
It's Taserface?

909
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,410
没错
That's right.

910
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,610
你的脸有电击能力吗
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?

911
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,240
是个比喻
It's metaphorical!

912
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,640
是啊
Yeah!

913
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:10,540
比喻什么
For what?

914
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,130
比喻
For

915
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,530
这个名字能让任何
it is a name what strikes fear

916
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,530
听到它的人  心生恐惧
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.

917
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:22,110
嗯
Okay.

918
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:24,140
好吧
Okay...

919
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,520
随你说吧
whatever you say.

920
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:27,160
你闭嘴
You shut up.

921
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,320
你就是下一个
You're next.

922
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,550
尤冬塔  我等了好久...
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...

923
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:34,360
怎么了
What?

924
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,680
对不起  真对不起
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

925
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,550
我就是一直在想象  先生  你早上醒来
I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir,

926
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:42,410
看着镜子
looking in the mirror

927
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,730
严肃地对自己说
and then in all seriousness saying to yourself,

928
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:49,750
"知道什么名字特别拽吗  电击脸"
"You know what would be a really kick-ass name? Taserface!"

929
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,180
我想象你就是这样
That's how I hear you in my head!

930
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,540
你的第二选择是什么
What was your second choice?

931
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,220
阴囊帽吗
Scrotum Hat?

932
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,560
新计划  我们先杀你
New plan. We're killing you first.

933
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,460
好吧
Well,

934
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:08,180
死也比做一辈子的
dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life

935
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,150
混蛋白痴  觉得电击脸很酷强
as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.

936
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:14,860
今天就杀到这儿吧
That's enough killing for today.

937
00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:20,440
她是灭霸的女儿
She's the daughter of Thanos.

938
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,360
我以为你是银河系头号的施虐狂
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.

939
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,570
那是爸爸雇我的时候
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.

940
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:30,840
大祭司想亲手杀了那狐狸
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.

941
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,300
而至少有12个克里省在通缉他
And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.

942
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,900
我保证
I assure you...

943
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,050
我可不像离了魔法棍子的老头子
I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick...

944
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:43,010
或会说话的森林野兽那么好对付
or a talking woodland beast.

945
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,190
我要10%的赏金
I want 10% of the take...

946
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,860
还有几样东西
and a couple more things.

947
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,120
我们有一整盒的手
We got a whole box of hands...

948
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,520
-如果那个不行的话  -挺好的
- if that one don't work out. - It is fine.

949
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,660
你觉得克里人会处死船长吗
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?

950
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,370
克里人自视仁慈  不会让他痛苦的
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.

951
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:06,660
就在这儿  这是我们最好的一艘船
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.

952
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,660
伊戈星球的位置发到导航里了
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.

953
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,900
等我们拿到钱就把那10%汇给你
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.

954
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,980
你打算拿你的那份做什么
What are you gonna do with your share?

955
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,410
我还是孩子时  我父亲会让
As a child, my father would have

956
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,970
我和卡魔拉在训练中对打
Gamora and me battle one another in training.

957
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,250
每次我姐姐赢了
Every time my sister prevailed

958
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:24,360
我父亲就会把我身体的一部分换成机械
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery

959
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,670
他说是希望我能像她一样强
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.

960
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:30,130
但她总赢
But she won...

961
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:35,990
一次又一次  从没一次手下留情
again and again, and again, never once refraining.

962
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,080
所以等我杀了我姐姐
So after I murder my sister...

963
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:43,280
我要买一艘战舰  装上所有杀戮武器
I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death.

964
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:44,710
我要像抓狗一样找到我父亲
I will hunt my father like a dog,

965
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,880
然后慢慢把他撕碎
and I will tear him apart slowly

966
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,590
一块一块地拆开
piece by piece...

967
00:52:48,590 --> 00:52:52,210
直到他能稍有体会我每一天所经历的
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain

968
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,300
无休止的深刻痛苦
I know every single day.

969
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,250
哦
Yeah.

970
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:01,100
我想的是买条漂亮项链什么的
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.

971
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,420
或是好看的帽子
Or a nice hat. You know,

972
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:06,850
让其他姑娘都说  "哎呀  真漂亮"
something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"

973
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:13,260
总之  一路顺风
Anyways, happy trails.

974
00:53:21,350 --> 00:53:24,440
我母亲跟所有人说我父亲来自星星
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.

975
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,170
她有脑瘤  所以大家都以为她是在妄想
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.

976
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:30,010
彼得
Peter...

977
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:32,600
听着  我真的很想相信这一切
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.

978
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:36,580
但你离开了这世上最棒的女人
But you left the most wonderful woman ever

979
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,390
让她孤独离世
to die alone.

980
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:41,920
我并不想离开你母亲的  彼得
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.

981
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,550
如果我不定期回到我的星球
If I don't return regularly to my planet

982
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:45,960
回归其内部的光
and the light within it

983
00:53:46,010 --> 00:53:47,570
这个人形将退化消逝
this form will wither and perish.

984
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:49,920
那你为什么不回来  你为什么叫勇度去
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?

985
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,180
偏偏叫一个罪犯去接我
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?

986
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,310
我是那么爱你母亲  彼得
I loved your mother, Peter!

987
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:58,320
我无法忍受去一个再没有她的地球
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth where she wasn't living!

988
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,610
你无法想象那是什么感觉
You can't imagine what that's like!

989
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,870
我非常清楚那是什么感觉
I know exactly what that feels like!

990
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,210
我不得不看着她死去
I had to watch her die!

991
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,020
我存在了千百万年
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence

992
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,200
犯下了很多错误  彼得
I've made many mistakes, Peter.

993
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,000
但你不是其中之一
But you're not one of them.

994
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,510
请给我个机会
Please give me the chance

995
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,790
做她会希望我做的那种父亲
to be the father she would want me to be.

996
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:33,660
关于这个星球  和其内部的光
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet

997
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:35,720
我有好多要告诉你
and the light within.

998
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,660
那是你的一部分  彼得
They are a part of you, Peter.

999
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,170
什么意思
What do you mean?

1000
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,120
给我你的手  儿子
Give me your hands, son.

1001
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:46,420
来
Here.

1002
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:49,120
这样端住
Hold them like that.

1003
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:53,180
好了
Now,

1004
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,980
闭上眼睛  集中精神
close your eyes and concentrate.

1005
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,890
让思绪进入星球的中心
Take your brain to the center of this planet.

1006
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,300
太好了
Yes!

1007
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:09,570
就这样
Yes!

1008
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:11,250
太好了
Yes! Yes!

1009
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:12,770
-太棒了  没事  -怎么回...
- Yes! It's okay. - What was...

1010
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,370
放松  集中精神
Just relax. Concentrate.

1011
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,090
你可以的  再来
You can do it. Bring it back.

1012
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:17,830
很好
Yes!

1013
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:22,340
很好  好了  塑形
Yes, yes, now shape it.

1014
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,000
感受那股能量
Feel that energy.

1015
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:29,750
就这样
Yes.

1016
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:34,930
你回家了
You're home.

1017
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:38,760
彼得
Peter...

1018
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,380
你是怎么来到这颗奇怪  愚蠢的星球上的
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?

1019
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:19,430
我还是个幼虫时被伊戈发现
Ego found me in my larva state.

1020
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,720
我在母星是个孤儿
Orphaned on my homeworld.

1021
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,010
他亲手养大了我  把我留在了身边
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.

1022
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:28,290
那么你是个宠物
So you're a pet?

1023
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,650
大概是吧
I suppose.

1024
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:34,140
人们一般都养可爱的宠物
People usually want cute pets.

1025
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,740
伊戈怎么会养个这么面目可憎的
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?

1026
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:38,490
我面目可憎吗
I am hideous?

1027
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:41,220
你简直丑得惊心动魄
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.

1028
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,340
但那是好事
But that's a good thing.

1029
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,200
如果你长得丑  还有人爱你
When you're ugly, and someone loves you

1030
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,140
你知道那人是爱你这个人
you know they love you for who you are.

1031
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,600
美丽的人永远不知道谁能信任
Beautiful people never know who to trust.

1032
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,900
那我庆幸我很丑
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.

1033
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,090
那些池塘  让我想起了有次
Those pools, they remind me of a time...

1034
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:06,540
我带女儿去我母星的遗忘湖
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.

1035
00:57:08,030 --> 00:57:09,400
她跟你很像
She was like you.

1036
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,910
难看吗
Disgusting?

1037
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,210
天真无邪
Innocent.

1038
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,060
德拉克斯
Drax?

1039
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,810
我得告诉你件事
There's something I must tell you.

1040
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,300
怎么回事
What's going on?

1041
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,620
这位恶心的虫子女士成了我的新朋友
This gross bug lady is my new friend.

1042
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,760
我学到了很多事  比如我是个宠物  而且很丑
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.

1043
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,400
你不丑  德拉克斯
You're not ugly. Drax!

1044
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,560
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1045
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:10,570
螳螂
Mantis...

1046
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,830
你能带我们去我们的住处吗
can you show us where we'll be staying?

1047
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:15,850
这颗星球上怎么没有其他生物
Why are there no other beings on this planet?

1048
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,970
这星球就是伊戈
The planet is Ego.

1049
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,100
狗不会邀请跳蚤来他背上住
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.

1050
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,570
你不是跳蚤
And you're not a flea?

1051
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,520
我是有用的跳蚤
I'm a flea with a purpose.

1052
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,020
我帮他入眠
I help him sleep.

1053
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,350
我走出来之前  你正要跟德拉克斯说什么
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?

1054
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,630
没什么
Nothing.

1055
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,240
你们的住处在这边
Your quarters are this way.

1056
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,620
我们明早把你们送去给克里人
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.

1057
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:56,760
之后你俩都活不长了
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.

1058
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,380
好啊  电击脸
Okay, Taserface.

1059
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,220
替我们跟其他人问好  电击脸
Tell the other guys we said "Hi," Taserface!

1060
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,910
这颗小植物呢  要我用石头砸碎它吗
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?

1061
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:13,400
不行  杰夫
No, Gef.

1062
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,110
这么可爱怎么能杀掉
It's too adorable to kill.

1063
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:16,880
送去裁缝那里
Take it to the tailor.

1064
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:21,840
别介意  但你的雇员都是混蛋
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.

1065
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:29,510
我做了20年的克里人战奴  是斯塔卡解救了我
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.

1066
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,990
他邀我加入了掠夺者
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.

1067
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,220
他说我只需要遵守准则
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.

1068
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:40,820
但我年轻
But I was young...

1069
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,440
贪心  愚蠢
and greedy, and stupid.

1070
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:48,590
就像你  偷了那些电池
Like you stealing those batteries.

1071
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,260
那更多是德拉克斯干的
That was mostly Drax.

1072
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,730
我和斯塔卡  还有其他船长
Me and Stakar and the other captains...

1073
00:59:56,270 --> 00:59:58,680
我们跟你和你的朋友很像
we weren't so different from you and your friends.

1074
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:01,600
那是我唯一的家庭
The only family I ever had.

1075
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:04,330
我违反准则后
When I broke the code...

1076
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,190
他们流放了我
they exiled me.

1077
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,380
我活该如此
This is what I deserve.

1078
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:13,390
等等  矫情女王
Slow down, drama queen.

1079
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:14,950
你或许是活该  但我不是
You might deserve this, but I don't.

1080
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,350
我们得逃出去
We gotta get outta here.

1081
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:19,490
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1082
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,000
他跟他老爸走了
He went off with his old man.

1083
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,580
-伊戈  -对
- Ego? - Yeah.

1084
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,750
今天净是些蠢蛋名字
It's a day for dumbass names.

1085
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:32,530
你笑了  就那么一刻  我有种温暖的感觉
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.

1086
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:35,260
但你那一口烂牙毁了这感觉
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.

1087
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:37,790
你是职业混蛋吗
You like a professional asshole or what?

1088
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:38,850
挺专业的反正
Pretty much a pro.

1089
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:41,640
你为什么没像说好的那样把奎尔送去给伊戈
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?

1090
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,650
他很瘦小
He was skinny.

1091
01:00:44,370 --> 01:00:48,260
能钻进我们钻不进的地方  适合偷盗
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.

1092
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:56,170
我知道我们怎么出去了
I got an idea on how to get outta here.

1093
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,720
但我需要你的小朋友
But we're gonna need your little friend.

1094
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,820
吉祥物  吉祥物
Mascot, mascot, mascot...

1095
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,320
小家伙好激动  该喝一杯
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!

1096
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:26,050
看他气成那样多可爱
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.

1097
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,400
他太有趣了
He's goddang precious!

1098
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:43,160
小树枝
Hey, twig!

1099
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:44,950
过来
Come here.

1100
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,840
过来
Come on.

1101
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,350
天呐  他们把你怎么了
Man... what did they do to you?

1102
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,450
你想帮我们出去吗
You wanna help us get outta here?

1103
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:05,740
我需要你去找样东西  然后拿来给我
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.

1104
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,320
在船长室  有个原型机机械鳍
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...

1105
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,360
就是我脑袋上戴的那玩意
the thing I wore on my head.

1106
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:16,850
床铺旁边有个抽屉  就在里面  红色的
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.

1107
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:17,850
懂了吗
You got it?

1108
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,570
那是我的内裤
That's my underwears.

1109
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,340
嗯  我就觉得
Yeah, I was pretty sure

1110
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,780
他根本就没听懂你说什么
he didn't know what you were talkin' about.

1111
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,800
你得解释得更细致点
You have to explain it more careful.

1112
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,890
是个原型机机械鳍
It's a prototype fin.

1113
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:11,160
那是只奥罗尼  机械鳍  格鲁特
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.

1114
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,910
这次你来解释
You explain it this time.

1115
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:14,820
好吧
All right.

1116
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,380
那是沃克的眼睛
That's Vorker's eye.

1117
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,420
他睡觉时会拿下来
He takes it out when he sleeps.

1118
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,720
去  再找
Go. Look again.

1119
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,200
把眼睛留下
But leave the eye here.

1120
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:24,920
干吗
Why?

1121
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,700
等他明早醒来
He's gonna wake up tomorrow

1122
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,710
会不知道
and he's not gonna know

1123
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,020
他的眼睛去哪了
where his eye is!

1124
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,000
那是张桌子
That's a desk.

1125
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,420
我们说了那玩意才这么大
We told you it was this big.

1126
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,200
拜托告诉我你们船上有个冰箱
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere

1127
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,360
里面全是切下来的人脚趾
with a bunch of severed human toes.

1128
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,220
好吧  那我们说好永远不再提这事了
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.

1129
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,970
你要打开的抽屉  上面有这个标志
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.

1130
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:04,950
好吗
Okay?

1131
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,300
什么  不
What? No!

1132
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,980
他以为你要他把那个当帽子戴
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.

1133
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:18,570
我不是那么说的
That's not what I said!

1134
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:20,750
-我是格鲁特  -他很庆幸你不要求他那么做
- I am Groot. - He's relieved you don't want him to.

1135
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,550
-我是格鲁特  -他讨厌帽子
- I am Groot. - He hates hats.

1136
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:23,340
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1137
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:24,750
讨厌任何人戴帽子  不仅是他自己
On anyone, not just himself.

1138
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,490
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1139
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,310
你还以为谁的脑袋形状很怪
One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head

1140
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:28,310
结果转眼发现
the next minute it's just because

1141
01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:30,230
原来那脑袋上戴了顶帽子
you realize part of that head is the hat.

1142
01:04:30,610 --> 01:04:32,130
所以你才不喜欢帽子
That's why you don't like hats?

1143
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:35,290
这些话非得现在说吗
This is an important conversation right now?

1144
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,560
不是那个
That ain't it.

1145
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:24,790
我并没想哗变的
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.

1146
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:29,370
他们杀了我所有的朋友
They killed all my friends.

1147
01:05:33,350 --> 01:05:35,960
准备释放第三飞行舱
Get the third quadrant ready for release.

1148
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:44,030
还有件事
One more thing.

1149
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,910
船上有奎尔那些老歌的备份吗
You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?

1150
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:39,720
他拿走了
He's got it!

1151
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,480
勇度拿走了机械鳍
Yondu's got the fin!

1152
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:42,440
上
Go!

1153
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,400
下面
Down there!

1154
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:25,550
你个疯子
You maniac.

1155
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,240
你会炸掉整艘船的
The whole ship's gonna blow.

1156
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,720
不会是整艘船
Not the whole ship.

1157
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:58,730
你是谁
Who is this?

1158
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:02,900
我要把勇度的飞船的坐标发你
I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.

1159
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,590
-释放飞行舱  -是  船长
- Release the quadrant! - Aye, Captain!

1160
01:10:05,590 --> 01:10:08,050
我只求一件事
I only ask one thing.

1161
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,540
你们的大祭司
That your High Priestess

1162
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,310
要告诉他是谁注定了他的毁灭
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.

1163
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,970
电击脸
Taserface!

1164
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,750
去哪  船长
Where to, Captain?

1165
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:42,800
伊戈
Ego.

1166
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,920
不行
No, boy!

1167
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,420
对于哺乳类来说
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body

1168
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:58,120
一下跳跃50次以上对身体有害
to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.

1169
01:10:58,120 --> 01:10:59,320
我知道
I know that.

1170
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:02,070
我们要跳700次了
We are about to do 700!

1171
01:11:15,490 --> 01:11:17,970
那么这一切有一天都可能属于我喽
So I guess this could all be mine someday.

1172
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:21,820
火箭  火箭  你在吗
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?

1173
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:30,080
你在干什么  彼得
What are you doing, Peter?

1174
01:11:32,860 --> 01:11:33,970
跟我跳舞吧
Dance with me.

1175
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:35,890
我才不跟你跳舞
I'm not going to dance with you.

1176
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:37,720
这是山姆·库克的歌
This is Sam Cooke

1177
01:11:38,190 --> 01:11:40,840
他可是地球最伟大的歌手之一
one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.

1178
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:12,560
德拉克斯觉得你不是个舞者
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.

1179
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,540
你要是敢把这件事说出去
If you ever tell anyone about this...

1180
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:17,670
我就杀了你
I will kill you.

1181
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:20,160
我们什么时候处理一下
When are we gonna do something about this

1182
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:22,130
我们之间心照不宣的情愫啊
unspoken thing between us?

1183
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:24,760
什么心照不宣的情愫
What unspoken thing?

1184
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:27,130
就是
This...

1185
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,730
像《欢乐酒店》里  萨姆和黛安那样
Cheers, Sam and Diane...

1186
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,530
电视剧里相互喜欢的一男一女
a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other...

1187
01:12:33,530 --> 01:12:36,100
但他们从不说破  否则收视率就要下降了
but never say it because if they do, the ratings would go down...

1188
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:37,250
就这种的
sort of thing.

1189
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,970
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There's no unspoken thing.

1190
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:42,930
这是22条军规  如果你说了
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it,

1191
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:43,890
那就不叫心照不宣了
then it would be spoken

1192
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:46,950
那你就是撒谎了  所以你不说
and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it...

1193
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:51,030
反而是在说实话  也就是承认有
you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.

1194
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,360
不  我不是那个...
No, that's not what I...

1195
01:12:55,850 --> 01:12:57,870
我们现在应该说的
What we should be discussing right now

1196
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,850
是这地方
is something about this place.

1197
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,680
有点不对劲
It doesn't feel right.

1198
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,690
你说什么呢
What are you talking about?

1199
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,210
是你希望我来的
You're the one who wanted me to come here!

1200
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:07,350
那个螳螂女
That girl Mantis

1201
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:08,780
她在怕什么
she's afraid of something.

1202
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:11,180
你为什么要夺走这一切
Why are you trying to take this away from me?

1203
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,260
我没有...
I'm not trying...

1204
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,240
他是我父亲  是我的血亲
He's my father. He's blood.

1205
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,070
你在地球也有血亲  你可不想回那儿去
You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.

1206
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:18,000
再说一遍  是你逼我来的
Again, you made me come here!

1207
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,400
而且地球  地球是我母亲死在我面前的地方
And Earth, Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.

1208
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,680
不  是因为那里是真实的  这里只是个幻想
No, it's because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.

1209
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,440
这是真的  我是个半人  记得吗
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?

1210
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,200
我担心的就是那一半
That's the half I'm worried about.

1211
01:13:28,370 --> 01:13:29,950
我懂了  你嫉妒
I get it. You're jealous

1212
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:32,830
因为我是半神  而你喜欢我比较弱的时候
because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.

1213
01:13:32,830 --> 01:13:35,350
你本就让人难以忍受
You were insufferable to begin with.

1214
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:36,750
我一直联系不上火箭
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.

1215
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,380
我要出去  看看能不能搜到信号
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.

1216
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:41,380
知道吗  这根本不是《欢乐酒店》
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!

1217
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:43,020
在这部剧里
This is whatever the show is

1218
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:46,080
一个人愿意敞开心扉面对新的前景
where one person is willing to open themselves up to new possibility,

1219
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:48,160
而另一个人却是个混蛋
and the other person is a jerk

1220
01:13:48,170 --> 01:13:49,840
不信任任何人
who doesn't trust anybody!

1221
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,750
这是部不存在的剧
It's a show that doesn't exist.

1222
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:53,740
所以它不会有任何收视率
That's why it would get zero ratings!

1223
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,870
我不知道《欢乐酒店》是什么
I don't know what Cheers is!

1224
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:59,270
我终于找到我的家人了  你不懂吗
I finally found my family. Don't you understand that?

1225
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,810
我以为你已经有家人了
I thought you already had.

1226
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:32,650
该死
Damn it.

1227
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:07,270
神经病
Psychopath!

1228
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,710
你搞什么
Are you kidding me?

1229
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:46,770
我赢了
I win.

1230
01:17:47,140 --> 01:17:48,900
我赢了  我打败了你
I win. I bested you in combat.

1231
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:51,250
不  是我救了你
No. I saved your life.

1232
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,360
你留我一命真是太蠢了
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.

1233
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:54,180
是你没下杀手
You let me live!

1234
01:17:54,180 --> 01:17:56,200
我不需要你总想打赢我
I don't need you always trying to beat me!

1235
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,050
我可没刚刚穿越宇宙
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe

1236
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,070
就为了争个输赢
just because I wanted to win.

1237
01:17:59,070 --> 01:18:00,790
用不着你告诉我我要什么
Do not tell me what I want.

1238
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:02,580
我不用告诉你你要什么
I don't need to tell you what you want!

1239
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:03,090
明摆着的
It's obvious!

1240
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:06,660
你才是想赢的那个  我只想要个姐姐
You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!

1241
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:16,020
我只有你
You were all I had.

1242
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,600
但你总想赢
But you were the one who needed to win.

1243
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,580
灭霸把我的眼睛挖出来
Thanos pulled my eye from my head

1244
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:26,120
把我的大脑取出来
and my brain from my skull

1245
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,260
把我的胳膊拽下来
and my arm from my body

1246
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,720
都是因为你
because of you.

1247
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:55,550
你没事吧  儿子
You all right, son?

1248
01:18:57,410 --> 01:19:01,780
我之前看见你女朋友怒气冲冲地走了
I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.

1249
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:02,700
是啊
Yeah.

1250
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:06,350
你听这首歌真巧
It's fortuitous you listening to this song.

1251
01:19:06,850 --> 01:19:08,570
-你知道  -《布兰迪》
- You know... - Brandy?

1252
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:10,240
镜子组合的
By Looking Glass?

1253
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,320
是你妈妈的最爱
A favorite of your mom's.

1254
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:15,430
是啊
Yeah, it was.

1255
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:17,860
是地球最伟大的音乐作品之一
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.

1256
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:19,900
也许就是最伟大的
Perhaps its very greatest.

1257
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:20,970
说得太对了
Yeah, yes!

1258
01:19:20,970 --> 01:19:24,900
彼得  你我就是那首歌里的水手
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.

1259
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:28,430
他在一个夏日出现
He came on a summer's day.

1260
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,430
带来远方的礼物
Bringing gifts from far away.

1261
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:35,500
就像我让你妈妈怀上的那个孩子
Like the child I put in your mother...

1262
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,040
或是你给卡魔拉的自由
or the freedom you brought Gamora.

1263
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:43,180
布兰迪  你是个好姑娘
Brandy, you're a fine girl.

1264
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:45,710
你肯定会是个好妻子
What a good wife you would be.

1265
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:49,720
我的生活  我的爱
My life, my love.

1266
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:52,660
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea.

1267
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:55,330
大海召唤着水手
The sea calls the sailor back.

1268
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:58,290
他爱那姑娘  但那里不是他的天地
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.

1269
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:03,160
大海召唤他  就像历史召唤伟人
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.

1270
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:07,550
有时我们无法享受凡人的乐趣
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.

1271
01:20:08,050 --> 01:20:10,150
你可能不是凡人  但我
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...

1272
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:11,250
不  彼得
No, Peter...

1273
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:13,870
只要这颗星球内的光不熄
death will remain a stranger to both of us

1274
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:16,250
我们就都不用面对死亡
as long as the light burns within the planet.

1275
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,080
我可以永生不死
I'm immortal?

1276
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:21,360
真的吗
Really?

1277
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,460
对  只要光还在
Yes! As long as the light exists.

1278
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:29,140
我可以用那光建造很酷的东西  就像
And I can use the light to build cool things like

1279
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:30,980
你当初建造这颗星球那样
how you made this whole planet?

1280
01:20:31,010 --> 01:20:33,550
你可能要花几百万年时间去练习
It might take you a few million years of practice

1281
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:35,900
才能得心应手  但  没错
before you get really good at it. But, yes!

1282
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:37,630
什么  这太
What! This is...

1283
01:20:37,630 --> 01:20:40,500
准备见识一个八百英尺的吃豆人雕像吧
Well, get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man

1284
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,330
旁边还有骷髅王[动画形象]和希瑟·拉克里尔[女星]with Skeletor and Heather Locklear.

1285
01:20:42,330 --> 01:20:43,030
你想干什么都行
You can do anything you want.

1286
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:45,180
我要做一些奇怪的东西
I'm gonna make some weird shit.

1287
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,430
但是  彼得  这是巨大的责任
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.

1288
01:20:48,430 --> 01:20:51,150
只有我们能重塑宇宙
Only we can remake the universe.

1289
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:54,120
只有我们能牵着宇宙的缰绳
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos

1290
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,260
领导它走向正确的方向
and lead it to where it needs to go.

1291
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,720
怎么做
How?

1292
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,330
跟我来
Come with me.

1293
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:22,650
德拉克斯  德拉克斯
Drax, Drax. Drax!

1294
01:21:22,650 --> 01:21:24,500
德拉克斯  我们得谈谈
Drax! We need to talk.

1295
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:27,750
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1296
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:30,790
但我喜欢稍微有点肉的女人
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.

1297
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:31,840
什么
What?

1298
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:33,380
我说我觉得你恶心
I tried to let you down easily

1299
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:35,430
就是不想让你太伤心
by telling you I found you disgusting.

1300
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:37,040
不  我不是想...
No, that's not what I...

1301
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:41,600
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1302
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:44,850
我在想象跟你有肌肤之亲
I'm imagining being with you physically.

1303
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:46,490
德拉克斯  我不是想
Drax... That's not...

1304
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,060
我对你不是那种喜欢
I don't like you like that.

1305
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:50,670
我都不喜欢你这个物种
I don't even like the type of thing you are.

1306
01:21:51,370 --> 01:21:52,850
没必要人身攻击
There's no need to get personal.

1307
01:21:52,850 --> 01:21:56,000
听着  伊戈得到了他想要的
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.

1308
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,420
我应该早点告诉你的
I should have told you earlier.

1309
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,800
我真傻
I'm stupid.

1310
01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:00,920
你们有危险了
You are in danger.

1311
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:08,160
那是什么
What is that?

1312
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:15,110
你得重新调整你看待生命的方式
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.

1313
01:22:15,110 --> 01:22:18,140
我们身边的一切  包括那个姑娘
Everything around us, including the girl...

1314
01:22:18,140 --> 01:22:21,610
一切都是暂时的
Everything is temporary.

1315
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:24,440
我们才是永恒
We are forever.

1316
01:22:25,060 --> 01:22:26,240
永恒不会无聊吗
Doesn't eternity get boring?

1317
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:28,370
如果你有目标就不会  彼得
Not if you have a purpose, Peter,

1318
01:22:28,370 --> 01:22:30,730
你来这儿就是为了那个目标
which is why you're here.

1319
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:33,440
我告诉过你  很多年前
I told you how all those years ago

1320
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:37,460
我有一股不灭的冲动  想找到生命
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.

1321
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,950
但我没告诉你的是
But what I did not tell you was how,

1322
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,750
当我终于找到它的时候
when I finally did find it...

1323
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:43,950
它是那么的
it was all so...

1324
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,460
令人失望
disappointing.

1325
01:22:48,450 --> 01:22:51,230
那时我才
And that is when I came...

1326
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,060
深深地顿悟了
to a profound realization.

1327
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:01,430
我内心寻找其他生命的渴望
My innate desire to seek out other life

1328
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:06,160
不是为了让我能游走于那生命之间
was not so that I could walk among that life.

1329
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:09,220
彼得
Peter...

1330
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:13,540
我找到了意义
I have found meaning.

1331
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,670
我看见了
I see it.

1332
01:23:37,310 --> 01:23:38,830
永恒
Eternity!

1333
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,840
天啊
Oh, my God.

1334
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:53,430
我们得离开这颗星球
We need to get off this planet.

1335
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:08,260
天啊
Oh, man.

1336
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:11,210
总之  我被粗鲁地打断之前我正在说...
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...

1337
01:24:11,210 --> 01:24:14,420
那时  我是个联邦快递的快递员
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.

1338
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:27,440
你干什么呢  小子
What the hell you doing, boy?

1339
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,280
从你说到他时的样子我看得出
I could tell by how you talked about him

1340
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:30,990
这个伊戈不是好人
this Ego is bad news.

1341
01:24:30,990 --> 01:24:32,850
我们得来救奎尔
We're here to save Quill.

1342
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:34,260
为了什么
For what?

1343
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:36,270
荣誉吗
For honor?

1344
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:37,240
爱吗
For love?

1345
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,770
不  我才不在乎那些
No. I don't care about those things.

1346
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:42,700
我想救奎尔  好证明我比他强
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!

1347
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,850
我能拿这事压他一辈子
I can lord this over him forever.

1348
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:49,050
你笑我做什么
What are you laughing at me for?

1349
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:54,230
你可以骗自己和其他所有人  但你骗不了我
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.

1350
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:56,020
我了解你
I know who you are.

1351
01:24:56,030 --> 01:24:58,460
你才不了解我呢  废物
You don't know anything about me, loser.

1352
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,800
我了解你的一切
I know everything about you.

1353
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:03,780
我知道你假装是最坏最狠的人
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest,

1354
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:05,640
但你其实最害怕
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.

1355
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:06,140
闭嘴
Shut up!

1356
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:08,840
我知道你偷你用不着的电池
I know you steal batteries you don't need

1357
01:25:08,850 --> 01:25:11,250
你推开每一个愿意忍受你的人
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you

1358
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:13,010
因为哪怕一点点爱
because just a little bit of love

1359
01:25:13,020 --> 01:25:16,730
也会提醒你  你内心的空虚多大多深
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.

1360
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:17,670
我叫你闭嘴了
I said shut up!

1361
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:19,650
我知道那些制造了你的科学家
I know them scientists what made you,

1362
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:21,660
根本没在乎过你
never gave a rat's ass about you.

1363
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:22,520
我说真的  哥们
I'm serious, dude!

1364
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,980
就像我自己的父母  他们把我
Just like my own damn parents who sold me

1365
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:28,430
他们的亲生儿子  卖去做奴隶
their own little baby, into slavery.

1366
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,960
我知道你是什么人  小子
I know who you are, boy.

1367
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,860
因为你是我
Because you're me.

1368
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,530
我们是一对儿什么样的人啊
What kind of a pair are we?

1369
01:25:42,860 --> 01:25:45,870
大概是一对儿要去对付一颗星球的人吧
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.

1370
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,470
好啊  好嘞  很好
All right, okay! Good.

1371
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,540
等等
Wait.

1372
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:50,780
对付什么
Fight a what?

1373
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,380
你们是什么人
Who are you people?

1374
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:57,130
这地方是什么
What is this place?

1375
01:25:57,130 --> 01:25:58,700
卡魔拉  放了她
Gamora, let her go!

1376
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:01,260
洞里的尸体  他们是谁
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?

1377
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:03,340
你在害怕
You are scared.

1378
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:09,740
我称之为扩张
I call it the Expansion.

1379
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,480
这是我的目标
It is my purpose

1380
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:13,600
现在
and now

1381
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:17,790
它也是你的目标了
it is yours as well.

1382
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,160
好美啊
It's beautiful.

1383
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,560
数千年来
Over thousands of years,

1384
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,200
我将数千个我的延伸根植在了
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself

1385
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,730
数千个世界上
on thousands of worlds.

1386
01:26:30,010 --> 01:26:33,980
我得实现生命唯一真正的目标
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...

1387
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:36,140
生长  传播
To grow and spread

1388
01:26:36,150 --> 01:26:39,360
覆盖一切存在
covering all that exists

1389
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,630
直到一切都
until everything is...

1390
01:26:44,930 --> 01:26:45,780
变成我
Me!

1391
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,040
她对我做了什么
What did she do to me?

1392
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:50,610
她已经把一切都告诉我了
She already told me everything.

1393
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:53,170
我只有一个问题
I only had one problem.

1394
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:55,640
一个天神
A single Celestial

1395
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:58,470
是没有足够能量完成这样的伟业的
doesn't have enough power for such an enterprise.

1396
01:26:59,470 --> 01:27:01,450
但两个天神
But two Celestials...

1397
01:27:01,450 --> 01:27:04,840
那或许就可以了
Well, now, that just might do.

1398
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:08,850
那些尸体
The bodies...

1399
01:27:09,740 --> 01:27:11,170
都是他的孩子
are his children.

1400
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:14,330
我所做的一切中
Out of all my labors

1401
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,450
我最喜欢的
the most beguiling

1402
01:27:15,450 --> 01:27:19,750
就是尝试将我的DNA嫁接到其他物种上
was attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.

1403
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:22,330
我原本希望这样的配对
I hoped the result of such a coupling

1404
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:24,910
足以为扩张提供能量
would be enough to power the Expansion.

1405
01:27:25,850 --> 01:27:28,610
我让勇度把一些后代送来给我
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.

1406
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:30,240
这有违掠夺者的准则
It broke the Ravager code,

1407
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:33,500
但我慷慨地赔偿了他
but I compensated him generously and

1408
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:36,030
而且为安抚他的良心  我说我绝不会伤害他们
to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.

1409
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,710
这倒不假  他们都毫无感觉
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.

1410
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:41,660
但他们一个个都让我失望了
But one after the other, they failed me.

1411
01:27:42,310 --> 01:27:45,460
没有一个携带了天神基因
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.

1412
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,490
直到你  彼得
Until you, Peter.

1413
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,840
我所有的后裔里
Out of all my spawn,

1414
01:27:51,430 --> 01:27:55,610
只有你继承了与光的联系
only you carried the connection to the light.

1415
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:58,700
我们得马上找到彼得  离开这个破星球
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.

1416
01:27:58,700 --> 01:28:01,380
伊戈现在肯定已经拉拢了他
Ego will have won him to his side by now.

1417
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,080
-他有办法...  -那我们直接走吧
- He has a way of... - Then we just go.

1418
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:04,060
不行
No!

1419
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,180
他是我们的朋友
He's our friend.

1420
01:28:05,190 --> 01:28:07,620
你们就成天冲彼此大吼
All any of you do is yell at each other.

1421
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:08,800
你们才不是朋友
You are not friends.

1422
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:09,870
你是对的
You're right.

1423
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,120
我们是家人
We're family.

1424
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,210
我们不丢下任何人
We leave no one behind.

1425
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:19,940
或许除了你
Except maybe you.

1426
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:22,120
天呐
Oh, my God.

1427
01:28:22,120 --> 01:28:24,600
我存在以来首次
For the first time in my existence,

1428
01:28:25,130 --> 01:28:27,960
真正不再孤单了
I am truly not alone!

1429
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:34,750
怎么了  儿子
What is it, son?

1430
01:28:38,090 --> 01:28:39,330
我的朋友们
My friends.

1431
01:28:40,430 --> 01:28:44,680
你瞧  这就是你人性的一面  彼得
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.

1432
01:28:45,450 --> 01:28:46,170
是啊
Yes.

1433
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:49,060
我们超越了那些东西
We are beyond such things.

1434
01:28:49,060 --> 01:28:50,090
是啊
Yes.

1435
01:28:52,810 --> 01:28:54,340
-好了  -但我母亲
- Now... - But my mother...

1436
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:59,120
你说你爱我母亲的
You said you loved my mother.

1437
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,870
我是爱她
And that I did.

1438
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:03,740
我的水百合
My river lily who knew

1439
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:07,140
她会唱收音机里播放的每一首歌
all the words to every song that came over the radio.

1440
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,570
我三次回到地球看她
I returned to Earth to see her three times.

1441
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:13,950
我知道  如果我再第四次回去
And I knew if I returned a fourth...

1442
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,750
我就再不会走了
I'd never leave.

1443
01:29:17,110 --> 01:29:18,260
扩张
The Expansion...

1444
01:29:20,210 --> 01:29:22,480
我存在的目的  就完了
the reason for my very existence, would be over.

1445
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:24,050
所以我做了我必须做的
So, I did what I had to do.

1446
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:25,960
但是
But

1447
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:30,620
让她患上脑瘤简直伤透了我的心
it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.

1448
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:36,260
什么
What?

1449
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,330
好吧
Now, all right...

1450
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:40,380
我知道这听上去很不好
I know that sounds bad.

1451
01:29:50,310 --> 01:29:51,280
你
Who

1452
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:55,370
以为你是谁啊
in the hell do you think you are?

1453
01:29:55,370 --> 01:29:57,290
你杀了我母亲
You killed my mother!

1454
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:58,580
我
I tried...

1455
01:29:58,580 --> 01:30:00,260
那么努力
so hard...

1456
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,210
找到最适合你的形态
to find the form that best suited you...

1457
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:07,400
这就是你的感谢吗
and this is the thanks I get?

1458
01:30:07,740 --> 01:30:10,860
你真得长大了
You really need to grow up.

1459
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:17,070
我本想跟你一起做的
I wanted to do this together...

1460
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:19,270
但看来你只能
but I suppose you'll have to learn

1461
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:22,700
做个一千年的电池  慢慢长进了
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!

1462
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:26,690
可算  火箭
Finally! Rocket?

1463
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:29,390
把发射器带在身边  我好找你
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.

1464
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:31,450
我们在一件旧施工设备里
We're in an old piece of construction equipment

1465
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:34,580
勇度曾用它来切开艾斯克维拉银行
Yondu once used to slice open the Bank of A'askavaria.

1466
01:30:34,580 --> 01:30:35,570
伊戈是个疯子
Ego's unhinged.

1467
01:30:35,570 --> 01:30:36,990
我知道  准备好
I know. Get ready.

1468
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:38,400
放  克拉林
Drop her, Kraglin.

1469
01:30:56,850 --> 01:30:58,090
不
No.

1470
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:12,330
我的生命  我的爱
My life, my love.

1471
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,760
我的女人是大海
My lady is the sea

1472
01:31:16,750 --> 01:31:17,620
彼得
Peter...

1473
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:20,910
这就是那海
this is the sea.

1474
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:05,820
你好啊  混蛋
Hey, there, jackass!

1475
01:32:15,850 --> 01:32:17,440
那是什么玩意
What is that thing?

1476
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:27,250
闪开  小笨格鲁特
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!

1477
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:34,190
我就说有点不对劲
I told you something didn't feel right.

1478
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:36,850
"我早说过"  我现在正需要听这种话
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.

1479
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,430
我不是回来了吗
Well, I came back, didn't I?

1480
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,620
因为我们有心照不宣的情愫
Because there's an unspoken thing.

1481
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:42,840
才没有什么心照不宣的情愫
There is no unspoken thing.

1482
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,260
你干什么呢  你差点害死我们
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!

1483
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:47,050
"谢谢  火箭"
"Thank you, Rocket"?

1484
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:48,430
我们都控制局面了
We had it under control.

1485
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:52,120
我们没有  那只是他真身的延伸
We did not. That is only an extension of his true self.

1486
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,400
他很快就会回来的
He will be back soon.

1487
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,470
蓝妹妹怎么在这儿
What's Smurfette doing here?

1488
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:56,560
我只想搭车回家
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.

1489
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,200
她还想杀我
She tried to murder me!

1490
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,200
我救了你  你个蠢狐狸
I saved you, you stupid fox!

1491
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,670
他不是狐狸
He's not a fox.

1492
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:03,750
-我是格鲁特  -我也不是浣兔
- I am Groot. - I'm not a raboon, either.

1493
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,030
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1494
01:33:05,030 --> 01:33:06,800
是"浣熊"  算了
"Raccoon." Whatever.

1495
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:11,580
怎么杀一个天神啊
How do we kill a Celestial?

1496
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:12,990
他有个核
There's a center to him.

1497
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,370
他的大脑还是灵魂什么的
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...

1498
01:33:15,370 --> 01:33:17,060
有个保护壳
Some sort of protective shell.

1499
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:19,640
在地表下的洞穴里
It's in the caverns below the surface.

1500
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:22,910
勇度
Yondu?

1501
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:33,580
推进器失去动力了
Thrusters are out.

1502
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,480
看来我该庆幸我长得瘦
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.

1503
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:37,740
否则你就会把我交给这个疯子了
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.

1504
01:33:37,740 --> 01:33:40,280
你还以为那是我留下了你的原因吗  白痴
You still reckon that's the reason I kept you around, you idiot?

1505
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,340
是你这么跟我说的  你个老笨蛋
That's what you told me, you old doofus.

1506
01:33:42,340 --> 01:33:44,600
我搞明白了其他孩子的下场后
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids

1507
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:46,320
我当然不能把你交出去
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.

1508
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,280
你说你要吃了我
You said you were gonna eat me.

1509
01:33:48,280 --> 01:33:50,050
那是玩笑话
That was being funny!

1510
01:33:50,520 --> 01:33:51,650
我可没想笑
Not to me!

1511
01:33:51,650 --> 01:33:53,230
你们真有毛病
You people have issues.

1512
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:55,350
我当然有毛病
Of course I have issues.

1513
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:58,260
那可是我老爸
That's my freakin' father!

1514
01:33:58,630 --> 01:34:00,340
推进器恢复了
Thrusters are back up.

1515
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,200
-我们该向上飞  -不行
- We should be going up! - We can't!

1516
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:19,200
伊戈想毁掉我们所知的宇宙
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.

1517
01:34:19,200 --> 01:34:20,370
我们得杀了他
We have to kill him.

1518
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:21,290
火箭
Rocket!

1519
01:34:21,290 --> 01:34:22,170
好嘞
Got it!

1520
01:34:36,260 --> 01:34:38,250
那我们又要拯救银河系了
So, we're saving the galaxy again?

1521
01:34:38,300 --> 01:34:39,330
大概是吧
I guess.

1522
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:40,500
太棒了
Awesome!

1523
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:44,820
如果我们救了两次银河系
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices

1524
01:34:44,820 --> 01:34:46,750
就能坐地起价了
if we're two-time galaxy savers.

1525
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:49,470
我真不敢相信你居然想到了这个
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.

1526
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:52,330
就是想想嘛  哥们  我们不是朋友嘛
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.

1527
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:54,830
我当然在乎那些星球啊  建筑啊
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings

1528
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:56,950
和各个星球上的动物啊
and all the animals on the planets.

1529
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:58,250
还有人呢
And the people.

1530
01:34:59,430 --> 01:35:03,850
那个坏脾气狗狗好可爱  他让我想死
The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!

1531
01:35:41,790 --> 01:35:42,860
飞行员
Pilots...

1532
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:44,620
释放先遣队
release envoy units.

1533
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:50,190
我们的传感器感应到电池在星球地表下
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.

1534
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:53,390
下潜
Dive!

1535
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:12,150
船长
Captain?

1536
01:36:12,630 --> 01:36:13,440
船长
Captain?

1537
01:36:19,180 --> 01:36:21,180
伊戈为什么找你来
Tell me why Ego wants you here?

1538
01:36:21,240 --> 01:36:23,480
他需要我跟光的基因联系
He needs my genetic connection to the light

1539
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,270
来帮他毁灭宇宙
to help destroy the universe.

1540
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:27,480
他还想教我控制能量
He tried to teach me how to control the power.

1541
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:28,790
你能控制吗
So, could you?

1542
01:36:29,180 --> 01:36:30,030
稍稍能吧
A little.

1543
01:36:30,420 --> 01:36:31,530
我做了个能量球
I made a ball.

1544
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:32,930
球
A ball?

1545
01:36:33,140 --> 01:36:34,900
我已经拼命去想了
I thought as hard as I could.

1546
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,510
我只能弄出来个那个
It was all that I could come up with.

1547
01:36:36,510 --> 01:36:37,590
你"想"
You "thought"?

1548
01:36:37,900 --> 01:36:39,660
你以为我控制这支箭飞的时候
You think when I make this arrow fly

1549
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,130
是用的脑袋吗
I use my head?

1550
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:04,820
那儿
There.

1551
01:37:04,820 --> 01:37:06,530
那就是伊戈的核
That's Ego's core.

1552
01:37:09,100 --> 01:37:10,890
外壳很厚  火箭
That ore is thick, Rocket.

1553
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,280
交给我吧
I got it covered.

1554
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:20,020
我们必须快点
We must hurry.

1555
01:37:20,090 --> 01:37:22,640
伊戈很快就会找到我们
It will not take Ego long to find us.

1556
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:27,930
稳住
Keep it steady.

1557
01:37:34,270 --> 01:37:36,600
钻透到核  然后杀死他
We drill into the center, we kill him!

1558
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:44,450
船长
Captain?

1559
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,820
怎么了  克拉林
What is it, Kraglin?

1560
01:37:46,200 --> 01:37:48,220
还记得阿耶莎那妞儿吗
Remember that Ayesha chick?

1561
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:49,320
记得  怎么了
Yeah, why?

1562
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:51,090
该死
Oh, hell!

1563
01:38:12,350 --> 01:38:14,190
你为什么不开激光炮
Why aren't you firing the lasers?

1564
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:16,100
他们炸掉了发电机
They blew out the generator.

1565
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:18,450
我记得我带了一个小引爆器
I think I packed a small detonator.

1566
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:20,670
有引爆器没炸药也没用
A detonator is worthless without explosives.

1567
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,400
我们有这些
Well, we got these.

1568
01:38:22,910 --> 01:38:25,030
这玩意的破坏性能杀死伊戈吗
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?

1569
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:27,210
如果能的话  会造成他整个
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction

1570
01:38:27,210 --> 01:38:29,070
神经系统的连锁反应
throughout his entire nervous system.

1571
01:38:29,080 --> 01:38:29,860
意思是
Meaning what?

1572
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,880
整颗星球都会爆炸
The entire planet will explode.

1573
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,810
我们得快点逃出去
We'll have to get out of here fast.

1574
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:35,290
我装了个定时器
I rigged a timer.

1575
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:36,910
走
Go!

1576
01:38:51,170 --> 01:38:52,890
他要来了
He's coming.

1577
01:38:54,630 --> 01:38:56,350
你不是说你能让他睡着吗
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?

1578
01:38:56,710 --> 01:38:59,330
在他想睡的时候  他太强大了
When he wants. He's too powerful.

1579
01:38:59,330 --> 01:39:00,600
我做不到
I can't!

1580
01:39:01,130 --> 01:39:02,980
你不用相信自己
You don't have to believe in yourself

1581
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:05,640
因为我相信你
because I believe in you.

1582
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:19,310
睡吧
Sleep!

1583
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:28,090
我没想到她能做到
I never thought she'd be able to do it

1584
01:39:28,270 --> 01:39:30,510
毕竟她一副很瘦弱的样子
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.

1585
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:33,950
我不知道我能拖住他多久
I don't know how long I can hold him.

1586
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:39,080
金属太厚了
The metal's too thick.

1587
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:40,200
要让炸弹达到目的
For the bomb to work,

1588
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,110
我们得把它放在伊戈的核上
we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.

1589
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:46,060
我们的大屁股钻不进这些小洞里
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.

1590
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,320
那么
Well...

1591
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:51,390
这主意糟透了
That's a terrible idea.

1592
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:54,010
我们就剩这一个主意了
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.

1593
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,400
难以置信
Unbelievable.

1594
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,450
"火箭  做这个  火箭  做那个"
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."

1595
01:40:00,470 --> 01:40:01,670
今天真够受的
What a day.

1596
01:40:09,490 --> 01:40:12,970
好了  首先你打开这个开关  再打开这个
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.

1597
01:40:12,970 --> 01:40:14,500
这样就启动了
That activates it.

1598
01:40:14,500 --> 01:40:16,770
接着你按下这个按钮
Then you push this button

1599
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:19,530
让你有五分钟时间逃跑
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.

1600
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:21,550
不管你做什么
Now, whatever you do

1601
01:40:21,550 --> 01:40:24,130
千万别按这个按钮
don't push this button

1602
01:40:24,130 --> 01:40:26,360
因为那样会立即引爆炸弹
because that will set off the bomb immediately

1603
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:27,910
我们就都没命了
and we'll all be dead.

1604
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:30,530
重复一遍我刚才说的
Now, repeat back what I just said.

1605
01:40:30,860 --> 01:40:32,280
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1606
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,790
-我是格鲁特  -对了
- I am Groot. - That's right.

1607
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:36,390
-我是格鲁特  -不
- I am Groot. - No!

1608
01:40:36,390 --> 01:40:38,720
不对  这个按钮会杀死所有人
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!

1609
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:40,180
再来
Try again.

1610
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:44,060
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1611
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:46,120
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1612
01:40:47,410 --> 01:40:48,060
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1613
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:50,020
不  你刚才就是这么错的
No! That's exactly what you just said!

1614
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:51,870
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

1615
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,910
你应该按哪个按钮
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?

1616
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:55,000
指一下
Point to it.

1617
01:40:55,860 --> 01:40:57,030
不对
No!

1618
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,670
你让他紧张了
You're making him nervous!

1619
01:40:58,670 --> 01:41:00,570
闭嘴  给我拿点胶带来
Shut up and get me some tape!

1620
01:41:00,570 --> 01:41:02,220
外面有人有胶带吗
Does anybody have any tape out there?

1621
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,990
我要把死亡按钮贴上胶带
I wanna put some tape over the death button.

1622
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,320
我没胶带  我去问问
I don't have any tape. Let me check.

1623
01:41:07,170 --> 01:41:09,590
勇度  你有...
Yo, Yondu... do you have...

1624
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,130
你有胶带吗
Do you have any tape?

1625
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,000
卡魔拉  你有胶带吗
Gamora? Do you have any tape?

1626
01:41:17,700 --> 01:41:18,530
胶带
Tape!

1627
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:20,130
算了
Never mind.

1628
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:24,790
德拉克斯  你有胶带吗
Drax, do you have any tape?

1629
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,350
对  透明胶也行
Yes, scotch tape would work.

1630
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,940
既然你没有  为什么还要问我
Then why did you ask me if scotch tape would work,

1631
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:31,210
透明胶行不行
if you don't have any?

1632
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:33,720
没人有胶带
Nobody has any tape!

1633
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,830
谁都没有胶带吗
Not a single person has tape?

1634
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:36,430
没有
Nope!

1635
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:38,140
你问过星云了吗
Did you ask Nebula?

1636
01:41:38,910 --> 01:41:39,600
问过了
Yes!

1637
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:40,800
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1638
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:42,150
我问勇度的时候
I asked Yondu...

1639
01:41:42,150 --> 01:41:44,870
-她就坐在他旁边  -我就知道你撒谎
- and she was sitting next to him. - I knew you were lying!

1640
01:41:44,870 --> 01:41:47,780
你包里装着价值连城的电池还有一枚原子弹
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.

1641
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:49,540
要说谁会带胶带  就是你了
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!

1642
01:41:49,540 --> 01:41:53,230
我就想说这个  什么事都得我做
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!

1643
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:55,590
你浪费了多少时间
You are wasting a lot of time here!

1644
01:42:02,220 --> 01:42:03,710
我们都要死了
We're all gonna die.

1645
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,090
后推进器又坏了
Rear thrusters are out again!

1646
01:42:08,090 --> 01:42:10,660
没那个发电机我们死定了
We're done for without that generator!

1647
01:42:24,270 --> 01:42:25,560
银河护卫队
Guardians...

1648
01:42:26,310 --> 01:42:28,420
也许这对你们会是个安慰
perhaps it will provide you solace

1649
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:31,040
你们的死  不会毫无意义
that your deaths are not without purpose.

1650
01:42:31,330 --> 01:42:32,900
而是会警告那些
They will serve as a warning

1651
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:35,380
想要背叛我们的人
to all of those tempted with betraying us.

1652
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:38,870
别想耍索维林族
Don't screw with the Sovereign.

1653
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:43,940
会很疼的
This is gonna hurt.

1654
01:42:43,940 --> 01:42:45,500
光说不练
Promises, promises.

1655
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,140
不
No!

1656
01:43:09,770 --> 01:43:13,730
不不不
No! No! No!

1657
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:18,580
要爆炸了
We're gonna blow!

1658
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:26,230
彼得  不
Peter! No!

1659
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,540
怎么了
What?

1660
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:48,900
你活像玛丽·波平斯
You look like Mary Poppins.

1661
01:43:49,310 --> 01:43:50,490
他酷吗
Is he cool?

1662
01:43:52,300 --> 01:43:53,690
当然  他很酷
Hell, yeah, he's cool.

1663
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,570
我是玛丽·波平斯哦
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!

1664
01:44:24,070 --> 01:44:25,740
螳螂  小心
Mantis, look out!

1665
01:44:37,960 --> 01:44:39,500
她只是昏过去了
She's just unconscious.

1666
01:44:55,720 --> 01:44:57,210
炸弹还有多久炸
How long until the bomb goes off?

1667
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:59,960
万一万一格鲁特没把我们都炸死
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...

1668
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:01,490
那还有六分钟
about six minutes.

1669
01:45:06,130 --> 01:45:08,890
克拉林  我们需要飞行舱来带我们撤离
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.

1670
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:09,670
倒计时5分钟
T-minus five minutes.

1671
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:10,740
是  船长
Aye, Captain.

1672
01:45:14,810 --> 01:45:17,680
克拉林到时  上面得有人接应
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.

1673
01:45:18,200 --> 01:45:19,990
德拉克斯  带螳螂走
Drax, take Mantis.

1674
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:23,930
我的乳头
My nipples!

1675
01:45:31,830 --> 01:45:33,010
卡魔拉
Gamora!

1676
01:45:37,070 --> 01:45:38,260
彼得
Peter!

1677
01:46:04,340 --> 01:46:05,700
别想多了
Get over it.

1678
01:46:05,870 --> 01:46:09,700
得了  彼得  我知道你并不想这样
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.

1679
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:16,650
我让你做出这样的选择  还算什么父亲啊
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?

1680
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:47,260
帅气
Yeah!

1681
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:52,210
很快  彼得  我们就将成为一切
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.

1682
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:56,060
别再惹我生气了
So stop pissing me off!

1683
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,880
我们得上去撤离点
We have to get up to the extraction point!

1684
01:47:25,530 --> 01:47:26,340
冲
Go!

1685
01:49:25,950 --> 01:49:27,370
我说过
I told you...

1686
01:49:27,610 --> 01:49:31,030
我不想一个人做
I don't want to do this alone.

1687
01:49:34,690 --> 01:49:36,340
你不能拒绝
You cannot deny

1688
01:49:36,340 --> 01:49:40,380
宇宙赋予你的人生目的
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.

1689
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:51,600
大家不要靠近
Everyone, I need you to stay back!

1690
01:49:51,660 --> 01:49:52,860
那是什么
What is that?

1691
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,490
不非得如此的  彼得
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.

1692
01:50:11,990 --> 01:50:15,040
你为什么要毁掉我们的机会
Why are you destroying our chance?

1693
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:21,080
别再否认自己的身份了
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.

1694
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,770
你是上亿
One in billions.

1695
01:50:25,820 --> 01:50:27,840
上兆  甚至更多中的唯一
Trillions. Even more.

1696
01:50:30,120 --> 01:50:34,790
生命怎么可能有更伟大的意义
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?

1697
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:41,310
我不是用脑袋控制箭的  孩子
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!

1698
01:50:41,870 --> 01:50:43,920
我是用心
I use my heart...

1699
01:51:18,890 --> 01:51:22,690
你不该杀了我妈妈  还捏碎我的随身听
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.

1700
01:52:03,060 --> 01:52:06,080
格鲁特  如果你听得到  快点
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!

1701
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,330
我不确定奎尔还能分散他注意力多久
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!

1702
01:52:09,660 --> 01:52:10,850
格鲁特  快点
Groot, hurry!

1703
01:53:07,020 --> 01:53:09,340
勇度  我们要炸了
Yondu, we're about to blow!

1704
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:10,750
上船
Get to the ship!

1705
01:53:10,930 --> 01:53:12,220
不能丢下奎尔
Not without Quill!

1706
01:53:12,220 --> 01:53:14,450
你还得照顾小树枝
You need to take care of the twig!

1707
01:53:15,620 --> 01:53:17,340
不能丢下你
Not without you!

1708
01:53:18,580 --> 01:53:21,720
我这辈子都没做过几件好事  耗子
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.

1709
01:53:25,300 --> 01:53:26,970
让我做这件吧
You need to give me this.

1710
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,880
一套太空服和一个飞行装置
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.

1711
01:53:40,290 --> 01:53:41,890
我一样只有一个
I only have one of each.

1712
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:56,710
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1713
01:53:57,210 --> 01:53:58,310
他说什么
What's that?

1714
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:04,310
他说  "欢迎加入他娘的银河护卫队"
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."

1715
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:06,890
而且他用的词不是"他娘的"
Only he didn't use "Frickin'."

1716
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:14,490
再见  小树枝
Bye, twig.

1717
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:19,350
我们回头得好好谈谈你说粗话的问题
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.

1718
01:55:14,690 --> 01:55:15,670
彼得呢
Where's Peter?

1719
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:17,910
火箭  他在哪
Rocket, where is he?

1720
01:55:19,240 --> 01:55:20,100
火箭
Rocket.

1721
01:55:20,300 --> 01:55:22,040
火箭  看着我  他在哪
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?

1722
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:30,790
不  我不能丢下他
No. I'm not leaving without him.

1723
01:55:37,710 --> 01:55:38,780
对不起
I'm sorry.

1724
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:41,910
我今天只能承受失去一个朋友
I can only afford to lose one friend today.

1725
01:55:42,930 --> 01:55:44,440
克拉林  走
Kraglin, go!

1726
01:55:44,550 --> 01:55:45,360
等等
Wait...

1727
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:47,510
奎尔回来了吗
Is Quill back?

1728
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,600
火箭  奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1729
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,950
火箭  奎尔呢
Rocket, where's Quill?

1730
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:58,430
火箭
Rocket!

1731
01:56:00,100 --> 01:56:01,580
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1732
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,600
奎尔呢
Where's Quill?

1733
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:14,720
不  我们得阻止它
No, we need to stop it.

1734
01:56:14,730 --> 01:56:16,210
我们得阻止它
We need to stop it.

1735
01:56:19,460 --> 01:56:21,380
不  停下
No. Stop.

1736
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:23,990
停下  听着  听我说
Stop. Listen. Listen to me!

1737
01:56:24,190 --> 01:56:25,730
你是个神
You are a god.

1738
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:28,090
如果你杀了我
If you kill me...

1739
01:56:28,590 --> 01:56:30,990
你就跟其他人一样了
you'll be just like everybody else.

1740
01:56:32,210 --> 01:56:34,090
那有什么不好
What's so wrong with that?

1741
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,440
不
No!

1742
01:57:25,690 --> 01:57:29,530
他或许是你生父  孩子  但他可不是你爸爸
He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy.

1743
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:36,050
真抱歉我一件事都没做对
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.

1744
01:57:37,150 --> 01:57:39,050
你是我的孩子我太走运了
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

1745
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:44,080
什么
What?

1746
01:57:56,480 --> 01:57:57,810
勇度  你干什么
Yondu, what are you doing?

1747
01:57:57,940 --> 01:57:58,900
不行
You can't.

1748
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:01,670
勇度
Yondu!

1749
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:07,750
不
No!

1750
01:58:08,490 --> 01:58:09,270
不
No!

1751
01:58:13,150 --> 01:58:14,110
不
No!

1752
01:58:17,350 --> 01:58:20,010
不不
No! No!

1753
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:22,740
不要
No!

1754
01:59:17,260 --> 01:59:18,850
我告诉卡魔拉
I told Gamora

1755
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:19,960
我小时候
how when I was a kid

1756
01:59:19,960 --> 01:59:23,030
会假装大卫·霍索夫是我爸爸
I used to pretend David Hasselhoff was my dad.

1757
01:59:25,050 --> 01:59:28,090
他是地球的一个歌手演员  很出名
He's a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy.

1758
01:59:29,970 --> 01:59:31,510
刚刚  我突然想到
Earlier, it struck me...

1759
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:37,060
勇度没有会说话的车  但他有会飞的箭
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.

1760
01:59:37,740 --> 01:59:39,820
他没有天使般美丽的歌喉
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel

1761
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:41,930
但他的哨声有如天籁
but he did have the whistle of one.

1762
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:46,070
勇度和大卫·霍索夫都会经历牛逼的冒险
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures

1763
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:47,790
勾搭性感的女人
and hooked up with hot women

1764
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:50,420
还打机器人
and fought robots.

1765
01:59:53,370 --> 01:59:56,780
看来大卫·霍索夫终究成为了我爸爸
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.

1766
01:59:57,900 --> 01:59:59,450
但其实那是你  勇度
Only it was you, Yondu.

1767
02:00:05,370 --> 02:00:06,760
我有个很酷的爸爸
I had a pretty cool dad.

1768
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,950
我想说的是
What I'm trying to say here is...

1769
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:18,570
有时候你寻找了一生的东西
sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life

1770
02:00:20,970 --> 02:00:22,900
其实一直在你身边
it's right there by your side all along.

1771
02:00:23,540 --> 02:00:24,810
你却不自知
You don't even know it.

1772
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:38,650
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

1773
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:41,790
他是喊你小树枝
He did call you twig.

1774
02:00:44,350 --> 02:00:45,370
星云
Nebula...

1775
02:00:50,640 --> 02:00:52,260
我跟你一样只是个孩子
I was a child like you.

1776
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:57,440
我每天只想着活到第二天
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.

1777
02:00:57,720 --> 02:01:00,190
我从未想过灭霸对你做了什么
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.

1778
02:01:00,970 --> 02:01:02,310
我想弥补
I'm trying to make it right.

1779
02:01:02,950 --> 02:01:05,570
整个宇宙中还有其他你这样的小女孩
There are little girls like you across the universe

1780
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,110
她们有危险
who are in danger.

1781
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:11,330
你可以留下  跟我们一起帮助她们
You can stay with us and help them.

1782
02:01:12,110 --> 02:01:14,370
我杀了灭霸就能帮助她们
I will help them by killing Thanos.

1783
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:16,160
我不知道那是否能做到
I don't know if that's possible.

1784
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:33,320
你永远是我妹妹
You will always be my sister.

1785
02:02:18,180 --> 02:02:19,000
彼得
Pete!

1786
02:02:22,680 --> 02:02:24,360
船长在一家旧货店为你找到了这个
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.

1787
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:26,590
说你有一天会回来的
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.

1788
02:02:29,210 --> 02:02:30,080
是什么
What is it?

1789
02:02:30,390 --> 02:02:31,170
叫Zune
It's called a Zune.

1790
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:33,680
地球人现在都听这玩意了
It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.

1791
02:02:33,680 --> 02:02:35,050
里面能存300首歌
It's got 300 songs on it.

1792
02:02:35,050 --> 02:02:37,280
300首歌
300 songs?

1793
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:43,370
等等
Wait.

1794
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:51,690
火箭把残片捡走  重拼了起来
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.

1795
02:02:51,690 --> 02:02:53,830
我觉得勇度会希望留给你的
I think Yondu would want you to have it.

1796
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,600
谢谢
Thanks...

1797
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:01,760
船长
Captain.

1798
02:04:14,250 --> 02:04:15,420
他们来了
They came.

1799
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:24,630
是什么
What is it?

1800
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:28,330
我给勇度以前的掠夺者朋友去了消息
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,

1801
02:04:28,330 --> 02:04:29,880
把他做的事告诉了他们
and told them what he did.

1802
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:35,010
这是掠夺者的葬礼
It's a Ravager funeral.

1803
02:04:52,660 --> 02:04:54,280
好啊
Yeah!

1804
02:04:54,290 --> 02:04:55,610
好
Yeah!

1805
02:05:03,070 --> 02:05:05,100
他终究没有辜负我们  船长
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.

1806
02:05:05,800 --> 02:05:07,460
是啊  孩子
No, he did not, son.

1807
02:05:08,820 --> 02:05:10,270
他没有
He did not.

1808
02:05:17,010 --> 02:05:20,440
永别了  老朋友
Fare thee well, old friend.

1809
02:05:22,720 --> 02:05:26,880
勇度·尤冬塔  我们在群星中再会
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.

1810
02:05:31,290 --> 02:05:32,940
他没把他们赶走
He didn't chase them away.

1811
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:34,310
是啊
No.

1812
02:05:35,570 --> 02:05:37,280
虽然他吼他们
Even though he yelled at them.

1813
02:05:38,350 --> 02:05:39,850
总那么尖酸
And was always mean.

1814
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:44,340
还偷了他用不着的电池
And he stole batteries he didn't need.

1815
02:05:49,660 --> 02:05:51,030
当然不会了
Well, of course not.

1816
02:06:15,650 --> 02:06:16,420
怎么了
What?

1817
02:06:17,550 --> 02:06:18,650
就是
It's just...

1818
02:06:21,230 --> 02:06:23,230
心照不宣的情愫
some unspoken thing.

1819
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:34,690
真美
It's beautiful.

1820
02:06:36,680 --> 02:06:37,550
是啊
It is.

1821
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:40,520
你也很美
And so are you.

1822
02:06:43,410 --> 02:06:44,610
内在美
On the inside.

1823
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:41,480
真是遗憾
You know, it's a shame...

1824
02:08:41,820 --> 02:08:44,350
要失去勇度这样的惨剧
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu

1825
02:08:44,350 --> 02:08:46,180
才让我们重聚
to bring us all together again.

1826
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:48,380
但我觉得如果他知道我们重新组队
But I think he'd be proud knowing that

1827
02:08:48,380 --> 02:08:50,230
一定会骄傲的
we are back as a team.

1828
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:51,500
我加入
I'm in.

1829
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:52,370
太好了
Dope.

1830
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:54,750
我想死你们了
I miss you guys so much!

1831
02:08:54,750 --> 02:08:56,220
太好了
Hell, yes.

1832
02:08:59,070 --> 02:09:00,950
我们去偷点东西吧
What say we steal some shit?

1833
02:11:20,290 --> 02:11:22,850
大祭司  理事会在等您
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.

1834
02:11:23,530 --> 02:11:26,390
